`They had eaten breakfast at a coffee shop in the station building.`
`...By chance, the inside of the shop had been decorated with Halloween colors, since it was October.`
`It seemed that Maria had really taken a liking to that.`
`Ever since, she had been making a fuss inside the train about wanting to have a Halloween festival, without caring that she was attracting the attention of others.`
`Halloween is popular in Europe and America, but people are hardly familiar with it at all in Japan.`
`The shopping district was colorfully decorated with orange pumpkins,`
` but the costume parades of children demanding sweets and saying "trick or treat" were nowhere in sight.`
`"Uu!`
` I want a Halloween festivaaal!`
` I don't want to wear these clothes, I want to look like a wiiiitch!`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`"The family conference isn't for playing.`
` We're going to meet Grandfather, so you have to dress up nice."`
`While it wasn't completely full inside the train, there were enough people here that almost all of the seats were occupied.`
`Among them, Maria was making a fuss, kicking her feet back and forth in her seat, while Rosa scowled at her.`
`Rosa had told her many times in a low voice to stop, but Maria was taking no notice whatsoever.`
`...Once Maria gets this way, no matter how much you try to explain the situation or calm her, she doesn't listen.`
`In the past, Rosa used to pamper Maria and give in to her at times like this.`
`But, that had probably been the problem.`
`Almost certainly, the young Maria had formed the wrong impression that if she kept complaining noisily, her mother would give in, and listen to her.`
`That error had been brought to Rosa's attention through an educational book, and since then, she had hardened her heart so as not to pamper her beloved daughter...`
`But Rosa could manage less and less mutual understanding with Maria, and it had become more and more common that she felt discouraged by her own powerlessness...`
`"Halloween, Halloween!!`
` Trick or treat, uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"I'm not giving you any sweets!`
` You just ate breakfast!"`
`"Trick or treat!`
` Trick or treat!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`As Maria kicked her feet, a stout old woman sitting in the seat across from Maria picked a candy out of her handbag and gave it to her.`
`"Uu! Got a treat, got a treat!`
` Look, look, Mama,`
` Mama!`
` Happy Hallowee~n!"`
`"Maria! You can't just accept sweets from strangers, remember?!`
` Return it!!"`
`"It's alright, hoh‐hoh‐ho.`
` She's a lovely young lady.`
` How old is she?"`
`There may not have been any malice in those words from the old woman.`
`{n}...But it seemed that Rosa had taken that in an extremely humiliating way.`
`"Maria! I'm always telling you not to accept sweets from strangers!!"`
`"Uu!`
` Uu!!`
` This one's mine!!`
` Uu‐`
`uu!!`
` No, it's mine!!"`
`"Let go of it!`
` Don't I always tell you to listen to what Mama says?!!"`
`"It's miiine!!`
` Miiiine!!`
` Uu!!`
` Uuu‐uuu!!"`
`"I told you, stop making that childish whining noise!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`Rosa reflexively hit Maria violently on her cheek.`
`{n}...In a flash, Maria started crying loudly.`
`Rosa immediately snatched the candy from Maria's hand and stuck it out towards the dumbfounded old woman sitting next to them.`
`"...Please, do not just give sweets to my daughter!"`
`"...............I'm, ...I'm very sorry."`
`Breathing heavily, Rosa once again held the candy out to the old woman.`
`...The woman looked confused for a moment about what she should say,`
` but then understood that perhaps her actions may have caused trouble for this parent and child, and she accepted the candy back, apologizing...`
`Then, Rosa finally took notice of her surroundings...`
`Her daughter's clothes were all messed up, she was crying and shouting with her nose dripping,`
` and there were many dumbfounded passengers watching them.`
`...Except for the sound of the train running, the railcar was completely silent.`
`Fortunately, that pitiful silence didn't last more than a short while.`
`{n}...However, in its place came an even more painful atmosphere as everyone whispered.`
`Maria shouted, cried, kicked and stomped her feet as usual, paying no heed to the people sitting around her.`
`...Impulsively, Rosa tried to slap her again,`
` but she noticed the cold eyes of the people in the train, and couldn't do that anymore.`
`When the train stopped, Rosa got off, forcibly pulling Maria by the arm, and almost dragging her along the ground.`
`As usual, Maria didn't stop crying.`
`Rosa took her to the end of the platform and hit her cheek again.`
`At the moment she was hit, Maria stopped crying for an instant, but before long, she shouted and cried even more than before.`
`Rosa, whose emotions had exploded, grabbed Maria by her collar, and pulled her hair as if to rip it out.`
`"Uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Uu!!`
` Mama, it hurts, Mama, it hurts!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Can't you hear me, I'm telling you to shut up!!`
` That "uu‐uu" of yours!`
` I'm telling you to STOP it!!"`
`"That's the reason you can't make friends in class, don't you get it?!`
` Get ahold of yourself!!`
` Why are you always a kindergartner inside your head?!!`
` Why can't you do what Mama says?!!`
` Why!!`
` WHY!!!"`
`Along with those severe words, Rosa hit Maria's head over and over again.`
`{n}The more Maria cried and shouted, the more Rosa hit her.`
`{n}And the more Maria was hit, the more intensely she cried and shouted...`
`"Mama, it hurts...!`
` Mama, it hurts...!`
` Mama, save me, Mama, save me...!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"WHY can't you just STOP that whining?!!`
` It's because you're like this that you can't make friends!!`
` It's because you're like this that Papa never comes back from his business trip!!`
` It's because you're like this that I...!!"`
`"E‐...excuse me, ...madam, is something the matter...?"`
`"Is there {i:something}...that you {i:want}...?!"`
`The one who timidly called to her was the station attendant.`
`{n}Rosa glared at him with a look that said "don't cut into the problems of a mother and child, stranger".`
`The station attendant surely hadn't wanted to talk to her.`
`{n}However, Rosa had been yelling on the platform for a much longer time than she had imagined.`
`...Her emotional scolding had caused the passengers on the platform to advise the station attendant that it would be a good idea to speak to her.`
`Rosa yelled at the station attendant that they would get on the next train and not to bother them anymore.`
`...And then, finally, or maybe we should say, for the second time, ...she noticed the passengers on the platform staring at her from the distance.`
`......Rosa sweated slightly; she felt the wind chill the sweat, tormenting her.`
`Maria was still crying, shielding her own head.`
`{n}......No—unless this beating stopped, she would probably keep crying forever.`
`"........................`
`......I've...`
`............done it again......"`
`As Rosa recovered from the evil heat inside her head,`
` ...she knew she had surrendered her soul to something bad again.`
`"Mama, Mama!`
` Mama, come back...!`
` Uu!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`Rosa fell to her knees and hugged Maria, whose face was all soggy with tears and mucus.`
`"......Maria... I'm sorry... I'm sorry..."`
`"Mama, ......Mama...`
` Welcome back, welcome back......"`
`Finally, ...Maria realized that her mother had turned back to being her mother.`
`{n}Then, she clung to her mother's body and cried, burying her face in her mother's chest.`
`"...Forgive your bad mama...`
` Forgive your bad mama...`
` ......I'm so...sorry...!`
` Please don't hate your mama......."`
`"Uu...`
` I'm perfectly fine...`
` Won't hate Mama.`
` ......Mama was just being possessed by an evil witch again.`
` ...But Mama came back, so it's okay."`
`"Yeah... ......Yeah...`
` ......Mama was...being possessed by an evil witch again...`
` ...I'm sorry, ......I'm really sorry......."`
`For a long time, the two of them hugged each other, asking for forgiveness and sending words of forgiveness back.`
`After a while, the two of them gradually calmed down and naturally drew their faces apart.`
`Maria's face, Rosa's face—both were deep red after crying their eyes out.`
`"...Do you want to have a Halloween festival, Maria?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...I wanted to show the pumpkin marshmallow to George onii‐chan and Jessica onee‐chan......"`
`That was a sweet which had been alongside the cash register at the shop where they had eaten breakfast.`
`......It was a fancy sweet that had a big orange marshmallow in the shape of a jack‐o'‐lantern stuck on the end of a stick.`
`Maria had wanted that and had insistently pestered for it.`
`{n}...Rosa had disallowed it, saying that there was no way she would buy such a sweet right after they'd had breakfast.`
`"......Okay, then, Maria.`
` ......I don't know if they sell those in this town or not, but let's get off and try searching for one, okay?"`
`"u, ......yeah!`
` Love you Mama, love you so much...`
` Thank you..."`
`"I love you too, Maria......."`
`The truth was that they had no time to waste loitering around at a stopover station.`
`{n}If they missed the airplane, they would fall half a day behind schedule.`
`She should have left home with more time to spare, but she had ended up leaving late after spending too long choosing Maria's clothes.`
`...Because of that, Rosa had been a bit impatient since the morning.`
`She looked at the clock.`
` ...They should be getting on the next train immediately.`
`But her daughter had firmly joined hands with her to go buy the sweet together, and that hand was warm.`
`...To Rosa right now, it was more important to regrow her bonds with Maria.`
`...Maria was not only Rosa's beloved daughter, ...she was everything Rosa had.`
`Fortunately, she could see that there was a big supermarket right in front of the station.`
`{n}...Maybe she wouldn't be able to find a sweet exactly like that one, but Maria would probably accept something similar.`
`Besides, Rosa also couldn't show up with a face swelled from crying.`
`{n}She would have to fix her makeup.`
`"We might not find a marshmallow exactly like that one, ...but I hope we can find a sweet that's similar.`
` ......And let's surprise all your cousins with it."`
`"Yeah.`
` ...If it's a sweet I bought together with Mama, anything is fine."`
`The two left the turnstiles of the station in this unknown town.`
`{n}Maria walked across the pedestrian crossing together with her mother, feeling very pleased, as though she was walking in an amusement park.`
`Both faces were still deep red,`
` ......but warmth could be seen between the two of them, mother and child, as they smiled at each other awkwardly...`
`".........Dear.`
` What are you doing in a place like this?"`
`"Oh, it's you.`
` .........It's nothing.`
` It's just that this was a pleasant place to think."`
`"...I have finished all the preparations for today.`
` For now, shall we relax and wait while drinking some tea?"`
`".........Sorry.`
` I'm always pushing all my problems on you."`
`"...Please.`
` Can't you rely on me more?`
` ...I am your wife."`
`"......Naturally, I'm grateful for you always coming to my aid.`
` ......For that very reason, I am able to devote myself to my work."`
`"I understand that.`
` ......About your work.`
` ......And the topic of Father's inheritance, right?"`
`"............That has nothing to do with you.`
` It's nothing more than my greedy siblings scavenging for rotten meat."`
`"......It's alright, dear.`
` ...Everything will work out.`
` Your work has never once turned out badly."`
`"....................."`
`Natsuhi softly cuddled close to Krauss's shoulder.`
`She spoke words to reward Krauss for the difficulties of his work, ...but Natsuhi was herself the one who knew best that it wasn't going well.`
`...Krauss's enterprises were something like a seesaw where large amounts of money swung.`
`A big investment leads to a large return,`
` but the swaying of a large‐scale seesaw is large yet sluggish, and not something which shows immediate results.`
`At times, he would make more investments so that the seesaw inclined faster towards the good side.`
`......Naturally, he did that because he had the confidence that, in a not‐so‐distant future, he would be able to recover all the investments made.`
`......However, the seesaws Krauss chose never turned out as he would have liked them to.`
`...His foresight wasn't wrong, ......but times were slow.`
`{n}They never caught up with him.`
`For example, think of a literal seesaw, placed in a park.`
`Due to its great popularity, there was always someone playing on it, so if he wanted to play, he would have to wait a long time for his turn.`
`...And then, one day, he found that seesaw vacant, straddled it realizing he was the first to arrive, and had it all to himself.`
`However, ...nobody got on the opposite side of the seesaw, so he couldn't play on it.`
`And no matter how much time passed, nobody came to the opposite side of the seesaw.`
`The seesaw is a popular piece of playground equipment, so if you waited, another person would definitely show up.`
`......Krauss noticed.`
`The weather looked like it was getting worse.`
`{n}That's why nobody was coming outside to play.`
`But the seesaw is a popular piece of playground equipment, so someone would definitely come.`
`...If he vacated his place because the weather seemed to be getting worse, someone would definitely snatch his place away,`
` and he would end up only longingly gazing from a distance, at someone else having fun playing on the seesaw again...`
`On one side of the seesaw, he continued to wait patiently, all alone...`
`{n}That was Krauss's current enterprise, and situation.`
`"............If only I'd had a bit more courage, ...and the self‐confidence to believe in my own foresight...`
`I'd never once......have failed."`
`"...Yes, that's true.`
` Your foresight is never wrong.`
` ......You are the only one who inherited Father's gift.`
` You inherited an innate disposition that none of the other siblings did."`
`"......Yet, I was unable to believe in it!`
` I always closed my own projects like a coward.`
` ......Why can't I trust myself?!`
` Who would trust a man who can't trust himself?`
` Nobody!!"`
`"......I'm always sitting myself down in the seats where the losers must sit;`
` ......my father, my mother,`
` ...and my siblings, all of them sneer at me...`
` How long before I am set free of this complex......`
` How long........."`
`...Only Natsuhi knew.`
`She knew of Krauss's anguish.`
` As the eldest son of the Ushiromiya family, who would have to shoulder a big responsibility, he couldn't open his pained heart to anyone, and would always be compared to his father's great enterprises...`
`".........I have finished all the preparations, so you can devote yourself to the family conference.`
` ...All of them."`
`"............Sorry.`
` ......Will there be any problems...`
`...with Father?"`
`"No.`
` ......Genji and Doctor Nanjo are on our side.`
` ...I'll never allow those greedy siblings to meet Father."`
`"Hello, Gohda here.`
` ......Yes, please leave it to me!`
` I'm anxious to put my skills to work for the big annual job."`
`Ingredients of varied colors had been gathered in the kitchen, and the preliminary arrangements had already been started.`
`Even though it was still morning, the ingredients for dinner were already in saucepans and steaming.`
`Normally, he had to deal with several assorted matters other than cooking, but on the day of the family conference, he could devote himself to it entirely.`
`To Gohda, who was originally a chef, this was surely the greatest gala occasion of the whole year.`
`"Yes, dinner will be an excellent calf steak...!`
` A wonderful cut of meat is already in the refrigerator anxiously waiting for tonight.`
` Please, let the other servants know to look forward to tonight—I will not disappoint them either."`
`It was rare for Gohda to be in this good of a mood towards his fellow servants.`
`To Gohda, who boasted about being a chef who worked exclusively for the Ushiromiya family, being given the right to show off his cooking at the family conference was the greatest honor.`
`"......OK.`
` I'm leaving it in your hands.`
` ...Also, is Kumasawa there?"`
`"Kumasawa‐san?`
` I happened to see her earlier, but she is not here.`
` I wonder if she went to make preparations at the guesthouse."`
`"......So she's loafing around again.`
` ......No, that's fine.`
` Alright then, I'm counting on you."`
`"Yes, leave everything to me...!"`
`Genji placed the telephone back on the receiver, sighing lightly.`
`Thinking of Kumasawa, who was no doubt hiding and slacking off even though things were this busy,`
` and the ostentatious Gohda, who only felt like doing anything on a day when he could show off, Genji sighed once again.`
`"Excuse me.`
` All the rooms in the guesthouse have been prepared."`
`"......We received instructions from Milady to make preparations for four people so that the children can stay there—what shall we do?"`
`"...I hear Battler‐sama is coming this year for the first time in six years.`
` I guess Milady wants to stay up late with the other three cousins.`
` ......Get them ready.`
` No need to tell Madam."`
`"I see.`
` Certainly."`
`"......So tonight, we'll have the late‐night shift, followed immediately by the morning shift tomorrow.`
` It looks like these two days will be tiresome."`
`"Speaking of that, the weather forecast is saying a typhoon will strike right over here...`
` Will that be alright?"`
`"...Unless the typhoon diverts greatly, it may affect the family's boat trip back, depending on circumstances.`
` The family conference schedule may drag on until about Monday or Tuesday.`
` ......It will probably be a long haul, but I ask you both to be careful not to make any blunders."`
`"............Shannon, relax and don't panic.`
` Kanon, be sure to greet them with courtesy."`
`"......Y‐yes.`
` I'll be careful."`
`"...I'll be careful."`
`"Today we will be entertaining a very important guest.`
` ...Make extra sure that everything goes smoothly."`
`"......I understand fully.`
` ...Any guest who visits here is important."`
`"Kanon.`
` ......We welcome, today,`
` an {i:important guest} in the truest sense.`
` Make sure you're prepared."`
`"......Yes."`
`".........Shannon, what's wrong?`
` ...You've been looking restless... Did you promise to be somewhere?"`
`"Huh?`
` N‐no, it's nothing.`
` My apologies..."`
`"Nee‐san.`
` An important guest will be arriving today.`
` ...Detach yourself from your private life."`
`"I don't, ...I don't know what you mean by private life..."`
`As Shannon blushed just a bit, she turned her gaze away from the clock.`
`......Was it about time for the airplane carrying the family to arrive at Niijima?`
`{n}...She had thought she had been hiding the fact that her long‐awaited reunion with George was making her heart palpitate, but Kanon, who stood at her side, understood her perfectly.`
`".........Shannon, please accept this from me without a word...!"`
`...Inside a bathroom stall, George was practicing something over and over, taking out a small velvet box hidden in his pocket like a quick‐draw desert gunman.`
`"That's not it...`
` Shannon likes a man with traction.`
` It, it must have a more powerful feel to it...!"`
`"Shannon, put this on your ring finger.`
` ...Tha‐that's an order, okay...?"`
`"Aah, if I don't say properly that it's on the left hand, maybe she'll put it on the right hand!`
` N‐no, Shannon isn't that ignorant,`
` aaah, but, if there's no free will, that'd be a little, I mean,`
` uuuuuu, nnnnuuuuuuu, muuuuuuuaaaaaaaaahhhh...!!"`
`As he crossed his arms, moaning and groaning, someone knocked on the door.`
`{n}George was startled back to reality.`
`"Hey, George‐kun.`
` You alright?`
` Got a stomachache or something?"`
`"Ah, ahahahaha, Uncle Rudolf...!`
` It's alright, I'm fine!`
` No need to worry, ahahahahahaha...!"`
`"You sure...?`
` OK then.`
` Don't strain too much.`
` Your ass'll burst."`
`Rudolf washed his hands, laughing cheerfully, and left.`
`...George knew that the most embarrassing part hadn't been overheard, and he patted his chest in relief...`
`"Kyrie, isn't Rosa here yet?"`
`"Not yet.`
` She's pretty late."`
`"It's a good thing the weather's delaying our flight.`
` If the schedule had been like normal, she'd've missed the plane by now.`
` What would she have done then?"`
`"...Rosa‐san is an adult now.`
` She'd manage it somehow.`
` No matter how old they get, older brothers always treat their younger sisters like children."`
`"Dad's always a kid, no matter how old he gets."`
`"What'd you say? If I'm a kid, that'd make you a baby.`
` Come on, Battler‐chan, up ya go~!"`
`"Stop it, that tickles, wahahaha, stooop!"`
`"You two look more like a couple of naughty kids than a father and son.`
` ...Look, she's here."`
`"Ohoooooooooh!!!`
` If it isn't Rosa‐san!`
` Maria‐chan, long time no see!!"`
`"Long time no seee!`
` Uu!"`
`"Maria!`
` Shouldn't that be "It's good to see you again"?`
` Greet your uncle properly."`
`"Uu.`
` It's...good to see you again..."`
`"There you go!`
` Well said!`
` How about some candy as a reward?!`
` ......Oh, huh?`
` Where'd I put 'em..."`
`"Rosa‐san, it's good to see you again.`
` It's good to see you too, Maria‐chan."`
`"It's been too long, Kyrie nee‐san, Hideyoshi nii‐san.`
` ...And......oh my, Battler‐kun?!`
` Look how big you've gotten...!"`
`"Ah, come on, hahaha...`
` It's embarrassing hearing that from every person I meet...!"`
`"Hey, Rosa.`
` You're late.`
` If the plane was on time, you'd barely have made it..."`
`"I'm sorry.`
` We had some trouble making our train connection.`
` So we're waiting on the weather yet again?"`
`"Oh, don't complain.`
` I much prefer the thirty‐minute plane trip to spending six hours bouncing about on a boat.`
` Even if we're kept waiting here for an hour, it's still much faster overall."`
`"Is that Maria...?`
` She sure has gotten big...`
` She's at that growing age..."`
`"You last met her...six years ago?`
` Of course she'd change.`
` Women are creatures who can be born anew in a single day, and all it takes is a change of heart."`
`"......Uu?"`
`Maria noticed a big man who she didn't remember mixed among the relatives, and hid behind Rosa's back, glaring at Battler.`
`"Hey, Battler, say hi.`
` The last time you met her, she was just three years old, so this might as well be the first time."`
`"Yeah, I guess she wouldn't remember if she was three!`
` Hey Maria, long time no see.`
` You sure have gotten big!"`
`"Maria.`
` This is Battler onii‐chan.`
` Uncle Rudolf's son.`
` ...Understand?"`
`"............Uncle's son is...`
` Uncle's the son...`
` ............??`
` ......Uuuu!!"`
`She was obviously on her guard.`
`{n}She must have found it frightening for a large guy like Battler to suddenly start speaking frankly to her.`
`Battler noticed that as well, and thought of various ways he might approach her.`
`Then, he noticed the sweet she had in her hand.`
`It was the jack‐o'‐lantern sweet that Rosa had bought for her.`
`"Oh, right, it's October, so that must be for Halloween.`
` Ihihihi, trick or treee~at!"`
`If you try to take a treat away from a small child, normally, you'd expect them to cry and start a fuss.`
`The adults thought that method wasn't good, but surprisingly, Maria looked pleased, her face splitting into a wide grin.`
`"Halloween, Halloween!!`
` See, Mama, Battler knows about Halloween too, see, see!!"`
`"Hey, call him Battler onii‐chan!`
` Sorry, Battler‐kun."`
`"No, no, I don't care.`
` Call me Battler.`
` And I'll call you Maria, too.`
` Come on, Maria, it's Halloween!`
` Trick or treeee~at!!"`
`"Trick or treeee~at!!`
` Kyahahaha, *giggle*giggle*!!"`
`From inside her handbag, Maria picked out a jack‐o'‐lantern sweet identical to the one she had in her hand, and presented it to Battler.`
`It seemed that Battler accepting it was enough to confirm their friendship.`
`The adults felt admiration at how children have their own ways of communicating.`
`To Maria, who had been complaining that she wanted to have a Halloween festival,`
` it must have felt like Battler was a friend, since he knew about trick or treat.`
`Her defensive posture from before was completely gone.`
`{n}Now, she was all merry, as though they had been friends for decades.`
`"Yeah, Halloween's a minor event in Japan, isn't it...`
` You often see people parading around in costume on the news over there, but I've never seen it in Japan."`
`"I wanted to wear a costume too.`
` Wanted to do trick or treat with all the cousins wearing costumes..."`
`"Yeah, I bet you did. Let's us two do it together sometime!`
` What would you want to go around as?"`
`"A witch!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}!"`
`"Oh, Milady, what are you doing in such a place?`
` Madam was looking for you."`
`"I'm here 'cause I don't {i:want} to be found.`
` ...I bet she only wants to nag at me anyway, all that crap like "is your appearance alright?" and "mind how you speak"."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Without a doubt."`
`"......You know.`
` When the day of the family conference comes, for some reason, I start getting weird feelings about this witch."`
`"Hoh...`
` Whyever do you say that...?"`
`"The family conference is the day when everyone related to Grandfather gathers.`
` ......Like, I hear Battler's coming for the first time in six years, this year.`
` ...Same kind of thing.`
` I always wonder whether some "relative" who hasn't shown themselves for several decades might suddenly turn up."`
`"............Hohoh.`
` Could a relative like that exist...?"`
`"I'm talking about that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ......Nobody knows her background.`
` Could she be Grandfather's mistress from long ago?`
` ......Maybe one of her descendants will suddenly show up and tell us to give back the gold we were granted or something, you know?"`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Krauss‐sama and the others will probably have a discussion about the problem of the Master's inheritance this year too.`
` ...With such excitement abound over talk of the witch's gold, I don't suppose it would be strange at all if the witch herself who granted that gold finally made her appearance."`
`"Kumasawa‐san, you know,`
` ...sure, you're always quitting one moment and working the next, but you've been here as long as Genji‐san, right?`
` ......You know more, about {f:5:Beatrice}, don't you?"`
`"......Well, I wonder.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` Even if I try to remember, this old woman here can't even recall what she had for breakfast this morning..."`
`"Kumasawa‐san, you're always escaping with those excuses, but you know something, right?`
` Sometimes I feel a kinda devious atmosphere about you, like you know something and you're laughing behind our backs..."`
`"Hoh‐hoh‐ho... How harsh.`
` ...I don't have any secrets.`
` ......The only thing I can say...`
`is that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is the Golden Witch, and that she is the other master who controls the night of this island."`
`"That's second‐hand talk from Grandfather.`
` Even though you get paid, it must be a pain to go along with Grandfather's tales."`
`"......But, I can say this much."`
`"...What?"`
`"......In ancient times, Rokkenjima was feared, and called "{ruby:Azuki Bean Island:Azukijima}".`
` The story told among the fishermen is that "Azuki" was a mispronounced form of "Akujiki", and in fact it was called "{ruby:Evil Appetite Island:Akujikijima}"."`
`"I've heard this before.`
` It's that story about how, 'cause of all the sunken rocks and shipwrecks around here, the fishermen got afraid and stayed away as much as they could, right?"`
`"......Evil spirits had settled down in Akujikijima, devouring human souls from time immemorial.`
` ...There were all too many people who got involved with this island and were dispossessed of their lives."`
`"And it all settled down when a traveling mountain ascetic or someone built that shrine and laid those souls to rest, right?`
` ...What a shady story."`
`"They say that shrine was destroyed by an eerie violet thunderbolt this summer, which tore through the darkness of the night..."`
`"Kumasawa‐san, you really like those stories, don't you?`
` Sure, it'd be pretty creepy if a thunderbolt wiped out the shrine keeping the dead at peace.`
` But, well, it was all worn out from the start.`
` I bet it just got carried away by some large wave.`
` Hahahahaha."`
`"The evil spirits of Akujikijima woke up from their sleep, and summoned {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` .........So if {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama ever happened to come for the family conference, then..."`
`"Then...?"`
`Kumasawa kept silent for a moment there.`
`{n}...Jessica, who wanted her to keep going, found that silence very eerie.`
`Once Kumasawa was satisfied that she had spooked Jessica just the right amount, she grinned broadly.`
`"Well now, I wonder what would happen.`
` Hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐hoh‐ho..."`
`"Whoa, that sounds wonderful."`
`"It does, doesn't it?`
` Isn't it useful for your work to enrich your heart and have an elegant time every once in a while...?"`
`"I think so.`
` The heart and the wallet must be rich.`
` Got it, I'll keep that day open.`
` Please, make the reservations."`
`"Will do.`
` No backing out!"`
`"Yeah, let's make it happen.`
` I love you, Kyrie."`
`After kissing the receiver, Rudolf hung up.`
`...In front of his seat, there were many executives with their sleeves rolled up, eagerly awaiting the end of that phone call.`
`"Sorry about the wait.`
` Have we had contact from America?"`
`"Yes.`
` It's from our lawyer Dale Watanabe on the external line.`
` I'll transfer it."`
`"......Overall, how do you feel about the situation?"`
`"Well, I'm afraid......it seems it is not all that favorable.`
` It seems they have no plans of withdrawing from the trial."`
`"......Looks like we can't fool 'em after all.`
` Tahaha...`
` Please, transfer it here."`
`"Very well.`
` Right away."`
`The executive ordered the secretarial office to connect him to the external line.`
`{n}Immediately, the telephone in front of Rudolf started ringing.`
`"Hello.`
` <Hello, hello>!`
` Apologies for the wait, Ushiromiya speaking.`
` Good day, good day.`
` How is it going over there?"`
`"<Hello, President Ushiromiya>.`
` Let's skip the greetings and get right down to business.`
` I have good news and bad news; which one shall we start with?"`
`"...The bad news can go first.`
` I can't fight if there's no dessert."`
`"Very well.`
` The bad news is that they have started preparing to prosecute us.`
` Just a few days ago, a verdict was handed down in a similar trial, overwhelmingly in favor of the plaintiff.`
` The defendants were also making roughly the same arguments as us, but they were rejected in everything."`
`"I'm afraid to say it, but if we face the courtroom as we are now, the probability that our argument will be rejected in its entirety is extremely high."`
`"...So that other trial was a disaster.`
` ......And I was thinking their conditions were more favorable than ours.`
` That's tough.`
` Then, what about the good news?"`
`"I managed to get in contact with their executives.`
` I explained our situation to them,`
` explained that we have no intention of tarnishing their brand image, and I managed to get their understanding."`
`"They will offer us conditions in a few days, and if these are carried out, they promised to withdraw from the prosecution.`
` This comes straight from the number‐two man on their board of directors."`
`"Your impression?"`
`"Honestly, I expect the conditions will be extremely severe.`
` I would assume that changing the company name and the brand name will be inevitable.`
` Where we do have margin in the negotiations is the amount of settlement money, the appearance of a public apology in a major newspaper, and the amount of time needed to carry out those things."`
`"Why don't they just come straight out with it and tell us to go bankrupt."`
`"They changed to their second president only a couple of years ago, and the new president doesn't have a firm foothold on the position yet.`
` If we resist until the bitter end, they fear that the forces who want to go against the current president wouldn't hesitate to do some work in favor of the enemy."`
`"Hence, it seems the big shots over there want to settle this matter as fast as possible too.`
` Therefore, for the sake of a quick settlement, we may still have enough leeway to pull for some mitigation of the conditions."`
`"At any rate, an absurd amount of money will be necessary, I guess."`
`"You need to be prepared for that.`
` And even so, I believe it will be much cheaper than disciplinary compensation."`
`"Thank you very much.`
` If there's any more progress, please contact me.`
` You bill highly, so I can't even chat around idly with you.`
` Hahahaha.`
` <Thank you, thank you, goodbye>."`
`Rudolf hung up the phone.`
`It seemed that the executives sitting in the reception seats could guess what had been said.`
`"......You get all that, you reprobates?`
` Well, to sum up.`
` If we can just pay them off, they're gonna let it slide.`
` All we have to do now is turn our focus onto how much."`
`"But, President.`
` The sum that Mr. Watanabe estimated for the settlement is too much.`
` We don't have that much of a margin...!"`
`"If we'd have known this was going to happen, we never should have started diversifying..."`
`"The calculations were that we could escape the capital crisis if we were able to endure for three years.`
` ...To be stabbed at this juncture is just...incredibly unfortunate...!"`
`"I guess we tripped and fell at the "step" of the "hop, step, jump".`
` I could cry."`
`"We have no choice but to draw the money from the main bank."`
`"Banks are no good.`
` They only bet their money on winning horses.`
` ...The situation is getting better, but we can't show weakness to the banks."`
`"......President.`
` Do you have any funds which are unaccounted for?`
` Funds that we aren't aware of?"`
`"Stop that.`
` Do I look like that kind of man?`
` The contents of my wallet are all exposed to you guys, alright?`
` The account books over there show all that our company has."`
`"In that case, ......we need to raise money.`
` We need a sponsor, who can draw in several million dollars for us, as soon as possible."`
`"......President!`
` Couldn't something be worked out with one of your associates...?!"`
`"President!`
` President...!"`
`"...Aaaah, calm down, you bastards.`
` ......I'll find a way to raise the money.`
` You guys just maintain the business and try not to fall to pieces.`
` They're saying they'll forgive us so long as we hand over the money."`
`"We already have thick pipelines in Asia.`
` This'll probably have consequences all over the place, but we can still maintain our deals.`
` The point is, this is a problem that can be entirely resolved just by handing over money."`
`"Just watch, I'll settle everything.`
` I won't let you out in the cold.`
` Start feeling like you're in good hands!`
` When this is all over, I'll be rewarding all of you guys with a champagne tower.`
` I promise.`
` So, just shut up and follow me.`
` Alright?!!"`
`The airplane suddenly shook.`
` Probably because of turbulence.`
`That shaking roused Rudolf from his sleep.`
`{n}He had woken up early that morning, and had ended up drifting off to sleep while resting in his seat.`
`"...Are you alright?`
` You're still very drowsy, aren't you?`
` You've been so busy with work lately."`
`"It's a damned good thing I am busy with work.`
` If I suddenly find myself with nothing to do, we'll all be out in the cold starting the next day."`
`"You're right.`
` Battler‐kun's come back now, so I'm afraid we can't just go around begging if things get rough."`
`"......Yeah.`
` We've finally got our whole family back after six years.`
` ...The man of the house is gonna have to give his best so we can all spend some family time together..."`
`When he looked outside the window, he saw that the airplane was already starting to drop in altitude considerably.`
`The fishing boats, which had only looked like black grains until a short while ago, had become clearly visible.`
`".........If I could prostrate myself before Dad and borrow ten mil in exchange for a punch to the head, I'd take at least a dozen, but...`
` Failing that, he'd better hurry and give up the ghost."`
`" .........I've mooched off him so much over the years, and now I'm going for the inheritance.`
` ............I'm going to hell.`
` ...It won't surprise me a bit if he doesn't want to see me......"`
`"......Could it be that you don't plan on appearing at the family conference this year either?"`
`Nanjo looked at Kinzo's face, sighing.`
`{n}...Kinzo's eyes remained rooted to those strange magic books.`
`"I have no intention of joining those vultures in their discussion.`
` They can discuss how they will suck my bones as they wish.`
` ......They are not worth a moment of my time."`
`".....................`
` ...My, my.`
` How troublesome..."`
`Nanjo shook his head slightly.`
`...To him, children and grandchildren were to be adored.`
`{n}And he believed that their growth was the only enjoyment for old men.`
`He found Kinzo's words to be a very sad thing.`
`"If the time comes when I must leave this room, I will show myself then.`
` ......Just as that one does not show itself."`
`Kinzo raised his face, and in the direction of his gaze was the portrait of the witch, respectfully displayed on the wall...`
`".................."`
`Inside Kinzo's head, there was no conception of today being the day of the family conference, the day when all his dear family would gather together.`
`......There was only the face of the witch in the oil painting, who never smiled outside her portrait...`
`Everybody knew that when Kinzo talked about {f:5:Beatrice}, unnecessarily cutting in would instigate his wrath...`
`"Today, I will...perform a certain ritual."`
`"Hoh.`
` ...And what would that be?"`
`"......It would be more accurate to call it a gamble.`
` ...After all, no miracles dwell in magic without risk."`
`Nanjo had already heard this countless times.`
`{n}You could call it Kinzo's favorite phrase.`
`......It seemed that Kinzo believed in magic and miracles arising through betting his own fate with a certain kind of risky probability and beating the odds...`
`"Kinzo‐san, you may once have been called the Golden Gambler,`
` but I cannot imagine what kind of gamble you will take on with that aged body, when you could go to the other world at any time...`
` I guess this will be worth seeing..."`
`"Hmph...`
` ......I see.`
` So, if it were up to you, unversed in magic, even this secret ritual I have thoroughly researched would be branded as a gamble.`
` So be it."`
`"...............If it is I, a believer in miracles, who wins...`
`you will be able to understand clearly that all my research, which probably only appears as vagary in your eyes, did bear fruit on this day.`
` If you win,`
` ......it will all end as, just as you observed, nothing more than the vagary of an old man who could go to the other world at any time."`
`"Hoh...`
` I wonder what on Earth is this gamble you will start...`
` As your friend, I only pray that you come out from that bet—no, was it a ritual?`
` ...I only pray, from the bottom of my heart, that you can come out from that ritual victorious."`
`"Mmhm... ...I thank you."`
`"......Speaking of that, Kinzo‐san.`
` I hear that a long‐awaited guest will be present at the family conference this year?"`
`"What......?"`
`Kinzo reacted in a unusual way to Nanjo's words and turned around.`
`"You know, Battler‐kun from Rudolf‐san's family.`
` I hear he will be coming for the first time in six years.`
` I'm sure he has become a splendid boy."`
`"............Oh, Battler.`
` ...I wouldn't describe a guest who has been away a scant six years as "long‐awaited"."`
`Upon hearing Battler's name, he showed an ill‐humored expression, as though he had been let down, and turned his back to Nanjo again.`
`"I guess these six years went by in a blink of an eye to you, sunk in your research in this room..."`
`"Hmph.`
` ......Perhaps a truly long‐awaited guest...`
`......will pay us a visit.`
` .........Everything depends on the results of the roulette.`
` ...The roulette is already starting to revolve.`
` Rouge, or noir?"`
`"............Tonight, let us enjoy ourselves as we see what kind of miracle the roulette will show us.`
` ...The payoffs are large.`
` And I don't feel like losing...`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}, ...you shall accept my bet........."`
`Just then, the telephone on the table rang.`
`That piercing noise seemed to displease Kinzo, and he picked up the receiver in order to preserve the silence as much as he could.`
`"......What is it?`
` I'm busy."`
`"It is Genji.`
` The family has arrived."`
`"And what does that have to do with me?`
` You can serve them some tea or something."`
`"...Certainly.`
` I will see to it."`
`Kinzo hung up the phone rudely.`
`Watching him, Nanjo sighed yet again, and shifted his attention outside the window.`
`As he was now, Kinzo would probably show no interest in any kind of guest.`
`...Was there any guest who could make Kinzo agree to come out when he should?`
`He had one person in mind, but that guest was one who could not possibly appear...`
`After a glance at the witch of the portrait, and her candid expression which he could not place as happy or sad, Nanjo gazed up at the leaden sky......`
`Now then, are the pieces all lined up......?`
`{n}Let us start a new game, with the pieces all lined up once more.`
`"Are there any problems...?"`
`"......Nope."`
`The witch looked at him in challenge while elegantly smoking her pipe.`
`And Battler?`
`{n}He just slovenly shrugged his shoulders as though she wasn't worth his time.`
`He wouldn't look her in the eyes.`
`{n}But that didn't mean he wasn't going to play.`
`...It signified his plain determination to never be taken in by the artifices of this being he faced.`
`{n}It was an expression of his powerful determination to fight.`
`"Don't tell me you don't have a plan...?"`
`"I don't know how you're going to play, so no, I don't have any plan.`
` ...Feel free to take the first move."`
`"Hmph... Naturally, I intend to.`
` In what way shall I destroy your defense?`
` In how many moves will I checkmate you?`
` ......That is how I will display my skills."`
`"............Whatever moves you come at me with, I will never believe in you!`
` ...As long as I stand my ground on that one point, I won't lose.`
` And what that means is this.`
` The way this game is made, you cannot win...!"`
`"Maybe you're right.`
` However...`
` I shall decide how many times we'll repeat this game.`
` It will be repeated over and over again, until I win and you admit defeat...!"`
`"In other words, this is torment.`
` Eternal torment that will continue until you surrender to me...!`
` Continuing eternally, until you acknowledge me and the existence of witches!"`
`"......In that case, I'll go along with you endlessly, any number of times, until you run out of patience.`
` I've never lost in such a "battle of wills"."`
`"Did some witch or other suggest that to you...?`
` *cackle*cackle*, that's just fine...!"`
`"I'm tired of listening to your rambling.`
` ...C'mon, get this started!"`
`"Come, let us begin!`
` I already know your moves far too well.`
` A defense doesn't amount to much if the plan behind it is known!`
` Don't think you'll be able to defy me with the same moves!!"`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` I have only one thing to tell you before we start."`
`"What is it...?"`
`"You're free to say anything.`
` But when it comes to whether I believe or not,`
` that is always`
` for me`
` to decide...!"`
`"No matter how great your magic is!`
` My soul won't yield to you.`
` You think this will be torture for me?`
` You're wrong!!"`
`"Then, what would you call it...!"`
`"This is torture for you!!"`
`"Someday you will yield to me and give up!`
` Until then, you'll be tortured over and over again!"`
`"How amusing, a fine metaphor!!`
` Torture where we torment each other, how truly amusing!`
` Come, we shall begin that torture!!`
` Ushiromiya Battleeeeer!!!"`
