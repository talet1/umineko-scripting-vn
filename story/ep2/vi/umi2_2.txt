`"Eeeeeeeeeh?!`
` What do you mean "separate rooms"?!`
` Then, Shannon, you and George nii‐san stayed in different rooms on purpose?!"`
`"Ye‐......yes...`
` umm, ......was it that strange a thing to do......?"`
`Since Jessica's cheeks had been stuffed with chocolate‐coated chinsukou biscuit that Shannon had brought as a souvenir from Okinawa,`
` it all flew out at Shannon when Jessica cried out...`
`"...Sha‐Shannon, why did you even go on a trip up to Okinawa then...?`
` And even alone with George nii‐san!"`
`"That's because... I mean... Since there's a very big aquarium in Okinawa, I was invited to go and...`
`I...like fish and stuff..."`
`"No, I mean, like...!!`
` This is a young couple going on an overnight trip, right?!`
` And you're saying there weren't even any hugs and kisses?!`
` To say nothing of the fact that the guy and girl were staying in different rooms!!"`
`"As for ki‐kisses, no comment.`
` ...ah, but we did hug, though...?`
` George‐san's chest was warm..."`
`"That's not the point!!`
` Aah, geez!`
` Why do couples like this exist?!`
` Aaah, geez!!`
` It's so damn irritating!"`
`From Shannon's perspective, a lot of things had happened and it seemed to have been a very happy trip,`
` but it looked like the missed opportunity had left Jessica feeling greatly unfulfilled.`
`For a while, Jessica chewed on her souvenir,`
` writhing on her bed as she complained about their romance.`
`Shannon and George had chosen to go to Okinawa because there was a huge aquarium there.`
`That was because their first meeting had revolved around an aquarium.`
`Since they had started at an aquarium, having their first overnight trip also be to an aquarium must have held some commemorative value.`
`"This was your special commemorative trip, your turning point!`
` Your first overnight trip!!`
` Shouldn't there have been all kinds of progress?!"`
`"And yet!`
` Separate rooms for the guy and girl?!`
` A couple taking two single rooms?!`
` Aah, geez, really, what's wrong with you?!"`
`"...Err, umm, ......but we're both single...`
` ...George‐san says that respecting boundaries is good manners between men and women......."`
`"For hell's sake, this overnight trip was so you could overcome that, wasn't it?!`
` You're not at the stage of mere hugs and kisses any more!"`
`"Mi‐Milady, I don't know what you mean by that, but...`
` Geor‐...George‐sama was a real gentleman with me until the end."`
`"That is, I mean,`
` ......I also...`
`wondered if those things would happen, you know,`
` ...but we, we may be going out, but...`
`I mean, it, it's not as if we are married or anything..."`
`"The kind of things you seem to be expecting, Milady,`
` ......I mean, we must do so only after we properly make a vow in front of God, and, umm,`
` ......ww...we mustn't...`
` au."`
`Shannon's face was bright red.`
`{n}She was restlessly fidgeting, making a circle with both hands, then a chain link, continually intertwining, separating and making heart shapes with them.`
`Apparently, the dramatic progress Jessica had looked forward to hadn't happened,`
` but it seemed that it had been a very important experience for Shannon in her own way.`
`...So in the end, no matter how much Jessica envied Shannon or made fun of her, it didn't change the fact that Shannon had a huge lead on her.`
`"Aah, I want a boyfriend toooo!!`
` I can't believe you beat me to it!!`
` We promised we'd get boyfriends at the same time but you snuck ahead and beat meeee,`
` aarrrrrrgh!"`
`"U‐umm...`
` Milady, you are a wonderful person, so I'm sure you'll find someone even more wonderful than I did, before long..."`
`"Don't try to console me!!`
` Shannon, you traitor, get outta here, you suuuuck!!`
` *cough*cough*, *cough*cough*cough*!!"`
`Jessica threw several cushions at her.`
`{n}But midway, she had an asthma attack and started to cough pretty badly.`
`Shannon hurriedly ran over to her and took a look on top of the nearby side table.`
`An adorable basket was placed there, and inside of it was Jessica's inhaler.`
`Shannon picked it up and handed it over to Jessica.`
`Jessica's asthma attacks always came suddenly.`
` Because of this, she had to carry this medicine around with her at all times.`
`She breathed in the medicine, and after some time spent holding back her coughing, her asthma finally settled down.`
`Shannon thought this a good chance to leave, bowed courteously, and made to exit the room...`
`As she did, one more small cushion came flying and hit Shannon on the head.`
`She looked around, and saw that Jessica was on the verge of crying, half of her face buried in her last and favorite cushion.`
` That face was red and meek...`
`"......Mi‐Milady......?"`
`"Sha‐......Shannon...`
` ...Be honest with me...`
` .........Is my...`
`.........hairdo and stuff...strange...?"`
`"What are you saying...`
` I think that your hair is very beautiful."`
`"Then, ...then then, are my eyes strange, or maybe my nose?`
` ...Or is it the way I talk after all......?`
` Is that why I can't get a boyfriend......?"`
`"Of course not.`
` Milady, you are wonderful enough as you are.`
` And I think that your charm will keep on increasing more and more."`
`"......But, it's only me who can't get a boyfriend...`
` Saku and Hina managed to find one, but I can't, I'm the only one......`
` Is it because I don't have any charm after all......?`
` You know, everyone's gonna be bringing their boyfriend along to the cultural festival......"`
`"I was so sure I'd have a boyfriend by then, I've been grandstanding about it...`
` .........But I can't get a boyfriend to save my life.`
` I'm the only one, the only one......."`
`Before she realized it, Jessica was shedding huge tears.`
`Jessica hadn't really planned on crying, and of course, she felt like supporting Shannon's progress in love as a friend.`
`...However, as she had made fun of Shannon, her true feelings had suddenly gotten mixed in, and the tears had just poured out on their own...`
`...Shannon understood Jessica's innocent and easily injured heart.`
`Jessica's usual rough style of speech...`
`was all just an attempt to protect her own easily injured heart.`
`......As a daughter and successor to the Ushiromiya family, and as a girl isolated on Rokkenjima, the only person she could expose her true feelings to was Shannon.`
`Shannon understood that.`
`{n}So, ...she strongly regretted feeling a little too self‐satisfied.`
`"...S‐.........sorry...`
` Crying like this, I'm weird.`
` Sorry......*sniffle*."`
`"You are a wonderful person, Milady.`
` There is no way that a nice man won't appear for you..."`
`".........Sha‐Shannon, it's about time for you, right?`
` If you don't go soon, Genji‐san and Mom are gonna yell at you.`
` I'm totally fine, so get going...!`
` Heheh, sorry for crying like this.`
` ......I'm such a moron."`
`Jessica faced away as if to show she wasn't looking for attention,`
` and waved her hand as though to drive Shannon away.`
`Shannon took that as a sign that she didn't want to be badgered any more,`
` bowed her head, and left the room...`
`When her footsteps disappeared into the distance, Jessica lay down on her bed, still hugging the cushion.`
`...Her expression was still a little meek, with tears in her eyes,`
` ...but for the first time in a long time, she had a very, very quiet and honest conversation with her heart.`
`"I also...`
`.........want to fall...`
`in love..."`
`As Shannon watered the flower beds in the garden in high spirits, she sensed someone's presence.`
`She turned around, thinking that if one of the family had come to visit, she must greet them,`
` ......and what she saw was that witch.`
`"B‐......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama........."`
`"It's been quite some time.`
` How are you?`
` Has your relationship with your special person progressed since last time?"`
`As {f:5:Beatrice} sat on the rose arch, she happily blew on her pipe.`
`Sitting in a place like that would crush the roses,`
` and it might have been dangerous if you fell off the arch, ...but after all, this was a witch.`
`That was surely an unnecessary concern.`
`"...Ye‐yes.`
` Thanks to you, ...it's going smoothly."`
`"Naturally; my magic is instantaneous.`
` ...You may even be feeling as if your meeting was a predetermined fate.`
` But that isn't correct; don't think for a moment this has anything to do with fate."`
`"......I, ......I understand that."`
`The witch was calling attention to something.`
` Two things, actually.`
`That originally, her relationship with George had been completely impossible.`
`{n}......And that her magic power was so great, it could manipulate that fate.`
`Shannon had become swept up in these sweet days, and had started to fall under the illusion that all fate was revolving around her.`
`...But the witch's words made her remember.`
`Her relationship with George had originally been impossible,`
` .........no, might also be impossible in the future as well...`
`"...*cackle*cackle*, sorry, sorry.`
` It's just like a doctor.`
` Even though you rely on them when you worry about your health, after you're healed, you forget even to thank them.`
` ......Witches have never known thanks, so I couldn't help acting a little rudely.`
` Forgive me."`
`".........I have never forgotten my feelings of gratitude.`
` ...I was able to achieve happiness thanks to your power, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` ......And without that power, George‐sama and I would have had no fate together.`
` ...I have never forgotten that."`
`"Sorry, sorry.`
` This was not my intent; I didn't come here to bully you.`
` Talking rudely is just my personality.`
` Do forgive me."`
`"...More importantly, I heard it through the grapevine...!`
` You two went on a little private trip.`
` I'm sure it was quite fun."`
`"Y‐yes!`
` It was very, umm, ...fun."`
`Shannon's face suddenly grew bright.`
`{n}The witch laughed lightly, as though that transformation was worth money.`
`"Already the person of your thoughts is no longer an object of one‐sided love.`
` You are a pair of lovers now.`
` ......To a pair filled with love, that alone is all they need in the world.`
` A wonderful, ideal world, so to speak?`
` Huhuhuhuhu!`
` Even witches would be jealous."`
`{f:5:Beatrice} laughed pleasantly.`
`{n}That smile was without a trace of malice, making her look as though she blessed the lovers' secret meeting from the bottom of her heart.`
`After that day, {f:5:Beatrice} had shown herself before Shannon every once in a while.`
`Even now, Shannon still thought of her as a creepy being.`
`...However, she was also hugely indebted to this person for bestowing the magic that had given her the relationship she had with George.`
`So Shannon was trying with all her might not to be surprised or scared.`
`"Oh, ...oh, yes.`
` ......Umm, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` I bought some confectionery as a souvenir from our trip.`
` ...Would you, umm, ......like some?"`
`"Hoh???`
` A souvenir for a witch.........?"`
`It seemed that even the witch who boasted of living for one thousand years hadn't been able to predict that she would receive a souvenir from a pair of sweet lovers.`
`When she saw that surprised expression, Shannon thought of the witch as a friend for the first time.`
`"Hohoh, Oriental cookies made from wheat flour and lard.`
` To wrap that in chocolate in the Western fashion is truly a blending of Japanese and Western style—the Silk Road of confectionery."`
`".........What?`
` What's so funny?"`
`"N‐...nothing.`
` My apologies."`
`This mysterious witch, who surely held a terrifying power,`
` was chomping down on the treats one after another, making a sound like a squirrel stuffing walnuts into its mouth.`
` After a while, Shannon couldn't conceal her laughter.`
`"Hmm, a fine treat.`
` ......I should serve you some Dolce Vita from Nero one of these days.`
` Roses are the symbol of eternal love.`
` I believe a rose dolce would be appropriate for you now."`
`The witch was in a great mood, having enjoyed the modern treats to the full.`
`"Umm, .........here.`
` I truly can't thank you enough.`
` I believe you have done more than enough for me already, so I'm returning this."`
`The thing that Shannon had softly set on the table was a gold‐colored butterfly brooch.`
`"There is no need to return it.`
` If you continue holding that, your relationship should remain firm in perpetuity."`
`"......I may have been given the chance to meet him through the power of magic.`
` But I think the effort that will make that encounter eternal should come from the two of us cooperating together."`
`"Hmm.`
` ......So love, too, is like a rose.`
` Too much fertilizer causes the roots to rot.`
` Some flowers cannot be raised without hard work.`
` In that case, do as you wish.`
` You may keep it in a box, rather than on your person.`
` That is my goodwill, given to you.`
` It would not please me to have it returned."`
`"Ah, ......my, my apologies...!`
` That's not what I..."`
`"*cackle*cackle*.`
` No harm has been done.`
` That brooch is already yours.`
` If you treasure that as proof of our friendship, that would comfort me a little."`
`"You may hold on to it, and gain its benefits.`
` You may also keep it in a box.`
` If you wish, you are even free to give it to another who is worrying about love.`
` ......But you should regard it as important.`
` It would certainly pain my heart if you did not take care of it."`
`According to {f:5:Beatrice}, she had appeared several times in the past in response to a person's summons so that she could give them an item imbued with some kind of magical power.`
`...However, most of them, after they used that power to resolve their worries,`
` would quickly come to think of that power as creepy, and, forgetting their feelings of thanks, they would throw away the items they had been given with disgust.`
`"Which is why I haven't often received thanks for my good will.`
` ......Let's see, is this the first time?`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`The witch laughed heartily, but it looked like a sad laugh to Shannon's eyes.`
`She herself had been like that in the past—no, maybe she was still like that now.`
`{f:5:Beatrice} was definitely a witch, with a strange and terrifying power.`
`Most likely, no one would go along with her if they could help it.`
`And even though on occasion they had relied on her strange power, it had undoubtedly resulted in fear more often than gratitude.`
`.........It must have deeply hurt the witch when that repeated over and over.`
`From the moment that she realized this,`
` ...Shannon decided to stop being frightened of {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`That had surely tormented her for over a thousand years...`
`Maybe she really liked the treats.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}, who normally spoke abusively, praised the black tea that Shannon served her, and looked to be in remarkably high spirits.`
`On such terms, the witch and the servant grew animated talking about the trip with George.`
`Shannon didn't know much about {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`First off, she was a ghost‐like being who appeared in unexpected places at unexpected times.`
`{n}And it seemed that not everyone could perceive that she was there.`
`It seemed that each person had something called a wavelength, and that there was a great amount of individual variation in people's ability to perceive the witch.`
`Only Shannon and Kanon could interact with her enough to exchange words like this.`
`...There were a few people who could sense her presence, but most people couldn't even feel that much.`
`From what {f:5:Beatrice} said, Krauss and his wife in particular had zero magical talent.`
` And no matter how much she followed them around, they would never notice her.`
`Previously, when Shannon had messed up and Natsuhi had gotten really mad at her, {f:5:Beatrice} had started playing around, hitting Natsuhi on the head with her pipe.`
`...Indeed, Natsuhi seems completely oblivious.`
`{n}But Shannon, watching that, had burst out laughing without thinking, and had gotten scolded even more.`
`"Then, ......what about the Master?`
` I hear that he has been doing research in magic, so I'm sure he would be able to notice you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama."`
`"............Kinzo is the same.`
` There is no one with a more pitiful lack of magical talent.`
` ...It's the blood.`
` He has so little talent, he is worthy of sympathy."`
`"..................?"`
`As soon as they started talking about Kinzo, it felt like the atmosphere around {f:5:Beatrice} changed.`
`She had spoken about Krauss and the rest's lack of magic talent as though she looked down on them, but she spoke of Kinzo in a different way.`
`Anyone connected to the Ushiromiya family would know about Kinzo's Legend of the Gold.`
`{n}...According to the legend, Kinzo had summoned the witch {f:5:Beatrice}, and had been conferred gold.`
`...In short, that implied she had some kind of relationship with Kinzo.`
`"So, you see, ......he attained that level despite not having a single scrap of talent.`
` ...It was through frenzied solitary study that he reached the tier of mage."`
`"That's.........something really incredible, right......?"`
`"......Mmhm."`
`The witch, who usually looked down on people, was unexpectedly praising someone.`
`...While she lambasted Kinzo, calling him talentless, she praised his efforts.`
`"And then, .........the Master summoned you with the power of magic......"`
`"Mmhm.`
` ......Well, I only answered the summons on a whim.`
` In this period where magic has long been denied, there I saw a being, without a scrap of talent, giving it his all.`
` It was just my luck that I'd decide to come and laugh at him.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*."`
`The words "just my luck"...showed that this had been a disaster for her.`
`Shannon hesitated over whether it would be alright to encourage her to continue, but {f:5:Beatrice} continued on her own, ignoring Shannon.`
`"The format and rules were all there, at least.`
` He'd mixed up a few of the procedures, but, well, in deference to his enthusiasm, I generously responded to his contract.`
` ......And I gave him a mountain of gold."`
`"Then the Master...used that gold and succeeded in business, and grew his wealth into what it is today."`
`"Mm. His talent in magic was nothing, but it seems he had talent in business and gambling.`
` ...Or was it because of his bravery and madness to stake everything on irrational bets?`
` ......Madness sometimes brings about magic.`
` Yes, if I look at it that way, maybe I can't really say that Kinzo had absolutely no magical talent.`
` *cackle*cackle*..."`
`Shannon felt like she was daydreaming.`
`While everyone in the Ushiromiya family knew of the story that Kinzo had delved into sorcery, summoned a witch, and been given gold, in actuality, it was all rambling that no one believed in.`
`And now the witch herself was telling her that it was true...`
`{n}Shannon felt a little flustered at this insane secret that only she knew.`
`"Then Kinzo, who had obtained a vast fortune, satisfied his every dream that could be granted in the human world.`
` .........And finally, he sought the truth of the world."`
`"The truth...of the world?"`
`"...The single element that makes up the world.`
` Kinzo, who had achieved everything one can obtain in the human world, wanted that, the final desire humans seek."`
`The single element.`
` .........She felt like she had heard the witch say those words before.`
`When {f:5:Beatrice} saw Shannon trying to remember what that was, she smiled awkwardly, waving her hand and saying there was no need to remember.`
`"......I underestimated Kinzo a trifle.`
` I truly hadn't thought that he would display such power."`
`"......And thanks to that, I'm in this state.`
` I've been sewn in place on this island for several decades now, without even a friend to drink tea with.`
` ...My voice reaches none I call out to, and I cannot go anywhere.`
` Such boring decades."`
`As she laughed in self‐derision, she tapped her teacup with her finger.`
` It made the clear sound of porcelain.`
`...Shannon didn't know whether the word "self‐derision" was really an accurate expression to describe the look on the witch's face.`
`Shannon didn't understand everything, but she could more or less figure out the situation.`
`{n}...And it was surely a topic that she should not press the witch on lightly, unless the witch started talking about it herself.`
`To sum up everything she had said up until now...`
`{f:5:Beatrice}, who had been summoned by Kinzo's magic, could not leave this island for some reason.`
` And she had lost her power and her form, living her days in boredom.`
`During that time, her words had reached Shannon, who never forgot to strongly respect the witch.`
` And she had made Shannon help her to regain her power, even if only a little bit of it.`
`...As a result, she had become able to drink tea with Shannon like this...`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, what in the world was that mirror you told me to break?"`
`"Aaah, that topic.`
` .........It seems that a lot of things happened on the islands around this area, in the distant past.`
` Bad things gathered due to that, attracting bad distortions.`
` It seems that a traveling Eastern mage or someone built a shrine for the repose of souls and sealed them in there."`
`"...That in itself had nothing to do with me, but unfortunately the foundation of that magical power was different.`
` It created a strong interference with my own magic, and was extremely bothersome."`
`"Is that how it was...?`
` I just assumed that it had been sealing you, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama..."`
`"I was not its target.`
` But it was a divine mirror.`
` As a result, my power was sealed away."`
`"......If I were to use food as an example, maybe it would go something like this.`
` Let's say that I have ordered some Western cuisine, which is being made in the kitchen.`
` However, when it comes time for it to be served, the seating is in the Japanese style, and Japanese tableware has been laid out."`
`"So the kitchen is unable to take out the plate which would be out of place, and no matter how long I wait, my Western food won't arrive—something like that."`
`"So I had you destroy that Japanese‐style seating, and return the area to a blank slate for a time.`
` Thanks to that, the meal I had ordered was finally delivered, and my power came back, you could say.`
` However, so far, only the aperitif has arrived."`
`"It will still be quite some time before the main dish.`
` As I am now, I'm even more faint than a fairy in a shoe store."`
`".........pf...`
`...ahahahahahahaha."`
`"Mh.`
` What's so funny?"`
`"Nothing...`
` I was just thinking witches' analogies are so interesting.`
` I never thought you could use food as an analogy to talk about magic."`
`"I had thought it to be a skillful description, if I do say so myself, and I certainly did not imagine it would be laughed at.`
` I feel a little offended."`
`A slightly sulky expression rose to the witch's face.`
`{n}...It would not have been a strange expression at all to see appear on the face of two friends as they enjoyed their tea.`
`"......Although I may not look it, I was known for doing extremely brutal things in the past.`
` ...I've gotten soft.`
` Now I can even have a foolish discussion while drinking tea with a human."`
`She was probably talking to herself.`
`{n}As {f:5:Beatrice} gazed at the sea birds tracing the horizon, she put her tea to her lips again.`
`"...The clouds have come out.`
` When the ocean loses its brilliance, it's nothing more than a gray puddle."`
`"You think so?`
` ......I think the ocean is a beautiful deep blue, even if it gets cloudy."`
`"............Hmph."`
`Maybe the witch had noticed the deep meaning behind Shannon's words.`
`...She laughed lightly and set down her empty teacup.`
`"......It seems that those things buried in your eyes aren't black pebbles anymore.`
` So?`
` ......Do you understand the feeling of furniture being reborn as a human?"`
`"...............Yes.`
` ...I didn't know that the world was this kind."`
`Since her relationship with George had begun, Shannon's face had grown brighter more often.`
`Her smile had made everything go smoothly, and had even changed her luck.`
`......Shannon made fewer mistakes in her work than she had before, and the family members' opinion of her was starting to change slightly.`
`Just the other day, Krauss, who rarely exchanged words with her, had suddenly started talking to her, surprising her.`
`"You've been making a good smile more often lately, haven't you?`
` Has something good happened?"`
`"N‐no...`
` But......every day is fun, yes."`
`"Hmph.`
` Isn't that good to hear.`
` Coffee is obviously more delicious if it's poured with a smile.`
` ......Could I ask for another cup, with that smile again?"`
`"Ye‐......yes!"`
`That had become a chance for Shannon to gain confidence in herself.`
`Of course, it didn't go beyond her own heart, and it wasn't so big a change that everyone could see it.`
`...But she had begun to change, bit by bit.`
`Shannon understood it clearly.`
` To know love was to gain a soul.`
` ...And therefore, to be born again from furniture to a human.`
`There was absolutely nothing mistaken in {f:5:Beatrice}'s words.`
`{n}......By knowing love, Shannon had learned what it was to be human.`
`"......These have been unusual snacks.`
` It was time well spent.`
` It's probably about time for you to return to your work.`
` Let us end our tea party now."`
`"......After all, it seems there are some who dislike your drinking tea with me, you see?"`
`"Huh?"`
`The witch gripped a teaspoon and flipped it with her fingers, sending it up in the air.`
`...Then, it was flicked by the fingers of some invisible person in empty space, and flew straight into a bush close nearby.`
`The bush moved violently, and Kanon came out.`
`{n}......It seemed that he had been there for some time, and had been watching their tea party.`
`The spoon was gripped in his hand.`
`{n}...If he had not been able to catch it by reflex, it might have hit him hard in the forehead and caused him to start oozing blood.`
`"..........................."`
`"Calm yourself.`
` Our tea party is over now, Kanon."`
`"How long were you there?`
` If you had called to us, I'd have poured you some tea too..."`
`"I imagine that you didn't want to interrupt a pair of women talking, right?`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".................."`
`Kanon kept silent, but it seemed that there was a slightly hostile look in his eyes.`
`...On the outside, he acted respectfully.`
` But unlike Shannon, Kanon did not trust the witch.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} rapped the table with her pipe, and the tea set turned into gold butterflies, which flew upwards in unison.`
`They scattered in every direction, and the cleanup was already done.`
`"It was fun, Shannon.`
` ...Let us meet again if the chance arises.`
` ......My magical power is still quite lacking.`
` It's tiring even to show myself."`
`"......If it tires you that much, never appear again."`
`Kanon had said it in a small voice, but it seemed the witch had heard it perfectly.`
`She giggled, but did not reply.`
`"Shannon.`
` Tell me more about George at our next tea party.`
` There are no snacks sweeter than a person's love life.`
` *cackle*cackle*cackle*.`
` I bid you farewell."`
`{f:5:Beatrice}'s body also became gold butterflies, which scattered in all directions and disappeared.`
`...It was a very fantastical and beautiful scene, like a blizzard of gold leaf.`
`For a while, Shannon quietly watched the witch's exit...`
`{n}Kanon approached her from behind, and spoke with a very different expression on his face than his sister's.`
`".........Nee‐san, didn't I tell you that you shouldn't hang around with her?"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama isn't that bad of a person.`
` ...Yes, she might be a little strange, but—"`
`"The fact that only we can see her is suspicious enough...`
` She isn't human.`
` Who knows what she's planning."`
`"Kanon‐kun, I think that's a little rude."`
`Shannon spoke seriously, which was unusual for her.`
`{n}...To Kanon, who knew her well, it must have seemed extremely serious.`
`Kanon showed almost excessive surprise at Shannon's style of speech, and remained silent.`
`"It's true that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is different from humans.`
` She has a terrifying power, so I think she is to be feared and respected.`
` ...But I think it's really rude to loathe her just for the single reason that she's different from a human."`
`"............I know what you're trying to say, Nee‐san.`
` ...You've changed since she gave you that brooch.`
` It's like you're the witch's prisoner.`
` She mediated your relationship with George‐sama, and now you're indebted to her."`
`"...Don't say things like that."`
`"She isn't human.`
` We don't know what she's thinking.`
` You mustn't trust her.`
` .........And we aren't humans either,`
` Nee‐san."`
`Kanon's words became more serious.`
` ...Those words probably gouged at Shannon's heart.`
` Shannon bit her lower lip and hung her head.`
`"We are furniture.`
` ...Even if we receive names and are treated as humans, that won't change how we were born."`
`You are no longer furniture...`
`Those words {f:5:Beatrice} had given her, which had made her happiest of all, floated through Shannon's mind...`
`"I am not...`
`......furniture."`
`"No, you are.`
` We are less than human.`
` ......Nee‐san, you're acting like you've forgotten that, ...and you're just pretending to be human.`
` You should understand that yourself."`
`"I'm......not furniture.`
` ...I'm human...!"`
`"No, you aren't human.`
` From the beginning, we have been unqualified to love or be loved."`
`It seemed that Kanon's criticisms had shifted focus from Shannon's interactions with the witch.`
`...Shannon also noticed that quickly.`
`"I heard from Milady.`
` Seriously, what were you thinking?`
` I can't believe that you would go on a trip with George‐sama...!`
` You've forgotten your place as furniture.`
` You've just been tempted by that witch, and mistakenly believe that you became human!"`
`"Listen, Kanon‐kun.`
` ............We certainly are furniture.`
` Lesser beings, inferior to humans."`
`"...But if we were to gain the missing remainder...`
`...wouldn't that mean we'd have become human?"`
`"......That couldn't happen."`
`"No, it could.`
` If we can gain that, we won't be furniture.`
` We can become human."`
`"..................`
` .........Ridiculous.`
` ...As if we......could."`
`Kanon spat that out, ...but weakly, and turned away.`
`That was probably...resignation.`
` ......The baptism of days upon days of suffering being furniture had firmly sealed his heart...`
`"...You can too, Kanon‐kun.`
` ......You can become a normal human."`
`"...........................`
` Stop it, that's the witch talking."`
`"That's right.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama taught me.`
` ......By gaining the single element of the world, we can become human."`
`"No—nobody's human without that.`
` ......That's why people spend their entire lives trying to gain that single element."`
`"I have no idea what you're talking about, Nee‐san.`
` I don't want to listen to rambling."`
`"Then I'll teach you in a way you can understand.`
` .........Look, see what I'm pointing at?"`
`"......?"`
`Shannon pointed straight at the sea, at the horizon.`
`Kanon didn't understand what she was actually pointing at, and couldn't do anything except look between the horizon and Shannon's expression, which looked like it was posing a riddle.`
`"The ocean.`
` ......Kanon‐kun, what color does the ocean look to you?"`
`It was an all too simple question.`
`Kanon tried to guess the meaning behind that question for a while,`
` but since he couldn't think of anything, he gave his answer straightforwardly.`
`"...It's an uninspiring dark gray.`
` So what?"`
`Objectively speaking, the sea, laid out beneath a cloudy sky, could probably be described best by Kanon's words.`
`......But as Shannon closed her eyes and smiled, she shook her head slightly.`
`"It looks deep blue to me."`
`"......Is that what you mean?`
` Like {c:86EF9C:using the word {ruby:blue:"{i:ao}"} for a green traffic light}?"`
`"No.`
` ......The ocean is deep blue.`
` If I can see that, and you can't,`
` ...then...that's exactly the reason..."`
`Kanon bit his lower lip and was silent for a while.`
`"........................`
` .........I.........can't see it."`
`"Kanon‐kun,`
` ......stick out your hand?"`
`As Kanon stood bewildered, unable to understand what she was saying, she took his arm, and opened the palm of his hand.`
`Shannon softly set something there.`
`It was that magic brooch, which she had received from {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}The magic charm, shaped like a gold butterfly, which could fulfill love.`
`"This is...`
`.........her......"`
`"No, this is mine.`
` ...So think of it as me and treat it with respect, okay?"`
`"....................."`
`After being told that, he couldn't just throw it away.`
`{n}Kanon didn't know what he should do, and he stood there confused for a while, the brooch still on the palm of his hand.`
`Shannon put the palm of her hand on top of Kanon's, and the brooch was warmed by both of their hands.`
`"This charm holds true magical power.`
` ......I'm sure that it will teach you an important emotion, Kanon‐kun."`
`"...There is nothing her magic can teach me."`
`"No, there is.`
` ......So wear it.`
` If that's embarrassing, I hear it's okay if you just hide it in your pocket."`
`"............Ridiculous...`
` As if I'd be led astray by her magic."`
`Even as he said that, Kanon couldn't be cold‐hearted towards something Shannon was pressing on him.`
`In the end, Kanon agreed reluctantly to take it,`
` saying he'd prove that he wouldn't surrender to the witch's power.`
` Shannon smiled and nodded back.`
`"I'm sure you can learn something important from it.`
` ......And I'm sure you can become human.`
` And when you do, I'm sure that this ocean will look a beautiful blue to you as well."`
`"...Gray is gray no matter how many times you look."`
`"That's wrong, Kanon‐kun.`
` ......It only looks like that because you have no{0}{nobreak:{m:-5:——}—}."`
`"Huh...?"`
`Because of the howling wind, he hadn't been able to catch the critical part of what she'd just said.`
`So Shannon said it once more.`
`...The single element of the world.`
` She spoke once more of a world full of that element, where the sea was deep blue.`
`"I'm sure you'll be able to see a deep blue ocean.`
` After all—"`
`{a:c:Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.}`
`".........Who is there?"`
`"......It is Kanon, my lord."`
`It was rare for Kinzo to leave his study.`
`{n}......However, that in itself didn't mean his noble research had been suspended.`
`He may have left the study for a change of mood,`
` but the thoughts filling his head were no different from those he had inside the study.`
`So Kanon knew that no matter what the time, speaking to Kinzo when he didn't want to be spoken to would always be a disturbance to his research.`
`"The weather is heavy.`
` Will it get worse?"`
`"Yes.`
` According to the weather report, it could rain at any time.`
` ......Shall I bring you an umbrella, my lord?"`
`"That won't be necessary.`
` ......You should leave me alone for a while.`
` If my children ask, say that you do not know where I am.`
` I am busy on a journey through my own thoughts."`
`"......Certainly.`
` Then, if you would excuse me."`
`During the time that Kanon bowed to him, Kinzo had already returned to his own world, and had forgotten that Kanon was there.`
`And once again, he began rambling to himself.`
`{n}Amidst those words, ...the name of that witch was repeated many times.`
`"......Ooohh, {f:5:Beatrice}...`
` My hand does not reach your smile...`
` What should I do to revive you—what should I do so that you smile at me once again...?`
` ......What is lacking?`
` My research? My materials? A catalyst?`
` Or is it magical power or luck or an oracle...?!"`
`"Ooohhh, {f:5:Beatrice}, what must I do to see your face one more time...?`
` Ooooooooohhhhhhh......"`
`As Kanon listened to his master's weeping voice over his shoulder, he turned around just once.`
`When he did,`
` ............right behind his isolated old master,`
` ......was the silhouette of a person that shouldn't have been there.`
`It was......the witch.`
`At once, Kanon, thinking that the witch must be plotting to do Kinzo some harm,`
` quickly ran back to Kinzo, trying to become a shield himself.`
`But when he saw the expression on the witch's face,`
` ...that emotion of his vanished.`
`Because {f:5:Beatrice}'s expression was one of...`
`...sorrow,`
` ......or maybe pity.`
`"You fool, Kinzo......`
` ......I am right here, can you not {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} me?"`
`Right behind Kinzo, as he repeated the witch's name over and over, desiring to be reunited with her more than anything else, was the witch herself.`
`And yet, Kinzo couldn't notice a thing.`
`{n}......Even when {f:5:Beatrice} tried to rest her hand on his shoulder, he didn't notice a thing.`
`"...Why, why does my hand not reach {f:5:Beatrice}'s smile?!`
` Is it the phase of the moon,`
` the period of the comets,`
` the alignment of the planets?!`
` What is lacking, what, what?!!"`
`".........It's useless, Kinzo.`
` ...Without love,`
` it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}."`
`Kanon took the brooch he had received from Shannon out of his pocket.`
`......Could he learn something that would enable him, too, to {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} what he currently could not?`
`".................................`
` Without love, it cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}."`
`He looked at Kinzo's back once more.`
`{n}......The witch was no longer there.`
