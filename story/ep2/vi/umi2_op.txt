`"Look, George‐sama!`
` They're so cute, look, look!"`
`Shannon found a pair of hammerhead sharks playfully swimming in the tank,`
` and made a fuss like a grade schooler seeing an aquarium for the first time.`
`"Yeah, they're really cute.`
` I almost want to eat them."`
`"I, I'd feel so sorry for them...`
` Did you know?`
` I hear that the only people in the world who come to an aquarium and say that the fish look delicious are the Japanese."`
`"Is that so?`
` ...I'm sure even Americans and Italians would want to eat these."`
`"...Uh,`
` ...um......`
`err..."`
`"Those clothes look good on you.`
` Really."`
`Shannon embraced her chest with both hands in embarrassment.`
`{n}...She apparently felt like she was being made fun of for wearing these clothes that she wasn't used to.`
`Even though George's face didn't show it, the truth was that even he was surprised at how easily those tremendous words had left his lips,`
` and he was as embarrassed as Shannon on the inside.`
`However, when he saw how embarrassed Shannon was,`
` he started to feel as though he was teasing the girl he liked,`
` and instead of embarrassment, ticklish amusement welled up in him.`
`......Wait, that isn't just a feeling.`
`{n}...I really am teasing the girl I like.`
`It pains me to admit it,`
` ......but I used to think that such embarrassing expressions had fallen so far out of use they no longer showed up even in manga.`
`On the contrary, if I'd seen a couple acting like that, I'd have felt like throwing rocks at them.`
`However, even if rocks were thrown at us now,`
` I'm sure they would be just like confetti celebrating us.`
`Now, I can't even remember those lonely days...`
`when I felt jealous of couples who were completely oblivious to their surroundings.`
`To use an old‐fashioned phrase, these would be truly rose‐colored days...`
`I was so entranced that I no longer even noticed the big tank of the world's largest aquarium.`
`Instead, I saw only Shannon happily playing with the fish, all her changing emotions showing on her face.`
`"...It's amazing, isn't it......?`
` It's my first time seeing a tank large enough for a whale to swim in."`
`"I heard that this tank is the biggest selling point here.`
` And that it's the biggest in the whole world."`
`"Is that so?`
` That's amazing.`
` ......It's really wonderful.`
` It doesn't even look like a tank at all, but rather like they sliced off a part of the sea with a knife and brought it here."`
`"It does, doesn't it?`
` This is a splendid little sea."`
`Despite its size, I hadn't thought of the tank as anything more than a tank.`
`That's why I thought her expression about slicing off a part of the sea with a knife was so interesting.`
`No matter how far humans broaden their experiences, in the end, they can only hold a single personal worldview.`
` Maybe that's why it's so interesting to interact with someone who has a different worldview.`
`I said that to her honestly.`
`{n}And she responded:`
`"Certainly, this might not be the real sea.`
` ...But, if those little guys swimming in there believe that it's a sea, then it certainly is a sea."`
`"Even though they're inside a finite tank."`
`"The sea is finite too.`
` No, even if it were infinite,`
` how much could we cover in our whole lives?`
` I'm sure that it would be so much smaller than a sea."`
`"...Certainly.`
` It's ironic, isn't it?`
` Even though the world is so vast, most of us live out our lives without ever leaving our own country."`
`"All it takes is the belief that it is a complete world...`
`for even the bottom of a narrow well to be a proper world, and a sea.`
` ...In the eyes of the frogs who live there."`
`Shannon, who spent her days as a servant on a small island ten kilometers in circumference called Rokkenjima,`
` said that with a smile.`
`After we finished walking through the whole aquarium, we had a slightly late afternoon lunch at a restaurant with a nice view.`
`Any boy's heart will jump about at the sight of a buffet.`
`I myself was like that in the past.`
`But with Shannon beside me, this buffet felt different.`
`{n}I couldn't shamefully make a huge pile of nothing but my favorite foods.`
`I was—how should I put it—worried about my appearance,`
` and chose a menu suited for a snob: toast, salad and coffee.`
`If I were by myself, I'd have made a pile of greasy stuff like yakisoba, mashed potatoes, gratins, and the like.`
`"Shannon, is that enough for you?`
` If it is, then I guess we men are animals with really bad fuel efficiency."`
`"...Umm,`
` I, I didn't mean to imply that......"`
`On Shannon's tray, there was only tea and salad.`
`{n}Maybe the very idea that she could "get away with at least one more dish" indicated I was thinking with my male stomach.`
`"What about you, George‐sama, will that be enough?`
` I think it's better for men to eat a little bit more.`
` ...You normally eat more than that for lunch, don't you?"`
`"Oops, right.`
` You already know how much I eat from when I have lunch on the island."`
`"Yes.`
` So, I was wondering whether your stomach isn't feeling well today..."`
`Shannon was showing concern that I wasn't feeling well.`
`{n}Apparently I had made her worry with my stupid attempt to impress her.`
`And in any case, it didn't seem like my stomach was going to let me keep this pretense up any longer.`
`"...Gah, ahaha...`
` I'll confess already.`
` I was just trying to look cool...`
` I just held back because I was with a girl..."`
`"I thought so.`
` Considering how much you eat during lunch at the family conferences, I thought that this wasn't nearly enough.`
` Please, don't be so reserved, and feel free to go and choose another dish."`
`"This isn't fair... All the embarrassment is on me.`
` What about you, then, Shannon?`
` Do you always manage your work for the Ushiromiya family while eating so little?"`
`"......Umm, uh,`
` ............au."`
`Shannon grew silent and blushed bright red.`
`Apparently, I wasn't the only one putting on a front.`
`{n}When I realized that, my embarrassment disappeared completely.`
`"That isn't enough for you either, is it?`
` Yes, normally, you eat more than this for lunch."`
`"A, a woman's stomach is made of magic, so this is enough...`
` au."`
`"This must mean that we were both trying to impress each other.`
` Let's not hold back anymore, shall we?"`
`I smiled to show that I wouldn't make fun of her anymore and stood up from the seat.`
`"We've come all the way to Okinawa—it would be a waste if we didn't eat some bitter melon.`
` I'll go get some fried bitter melon or something.`
` Come with me, Shannon.`
` C'mon, c'mon."`
`"Ah, yes...!"`
`To anyone watching us, we might have seemed like a pretty humorous—and above all embarrassing—couple.`
`But it's only after becoming a couple that you realize.`
`This banter means the world to us, and {i:is} our world.`
`{n}So, no matter how cold the looks we might have been getting from other people, we wouldn't even notice.`
`......Indeed, at this age, I finally understand the feelings of couples who want to endlessly flirt without any regard to their surroundings.`
`After I returned with a plate piled up with fried food, Shannon arrived with a lovely cake.`
`While laughing at our fake stoicism, we resumed our lunch.`
`"It's a shame that it's so cloudy, considering this restaurant has such a view of the sea."`
`Our window seats, which we were lucky to get, showed us seaside scenery so grandiose that it didn't even fit entirely within our field of vision.`
`However, because of the cloudy sky, it was a far cry from its normal beauty.`
`"Yes, it is.`
` If it had been clear, we would have seen quite the deep blue sea."`
`"Yes.`
` I imagine you're used to seeing the sea on Rokkenjima, but the sea here would surely have been an exceptional blue.`
` ...It's a real shame."`
`"Aah, but—no matter how blue it is, the sea I see during work might as well be gray.`
` But, today, I'm not working, so...I mean..."`
`Apparently, Shannon was doing her best to say an embarrassing line.`
` But I grade harshly.`
`"So close.`
` If only you'd said "when I look at it with you, even the grayest sea looks deep blue",`
` I'd have given you full marks and a reward."`
`"Uh,`
` ah,`
` I, I, I'm sorry......`
` nnnnnn..."`
`"Wanna hear what the reward would have been...?"`
`"Umm,`
` ......`
`uh,`
` if you wouldn't mind......"`
`"No.`
` I won't tell you.`
` Ahahahahahaha."`
`"Tha‐that's not fair..."`
`When I was in elementary school, I was always the kid that got bullied.`
`{n}When everyone teased me, I grew nervous and speechless, to the delight of the bullies.`
`Back then, I wondered why everyone teased me.`
`But now, teasing Shannon like this, I understand why.`
`{n}This is so much fun.`
`I can play with her emotions however I please,`
` ...and I can have them all to myself.`
`Right now, I can't think of any higher pleasure.`
`Which is exactly why I have to treat her lightly.`
`{n}I don't want her to get embarrassed and have a bad time.`
`{n}So I decided to end the topic there and then.`
`{n}It's not good to be too persistent.`
`"When you've finished your lunch, do you want to take a walk on the beach?`
` Perhaps the clouds will clear up and we'll be able to see a picturesque sea."`
`"That's a nice idea.`
` I'd like to do that."`
`"OK, that's what we'll do.`
` ...But that looks like a really delicious cake.`
` I wonder if I should get one like that too."`
`"You mustn't...`
` If you eat cake after already eating so much, you will get fat.`
` Hideyoshi‐sama's blood seems to run pretty thick in you, George‐sama, so if you don't take care, you will get chubby."`
`"So, Shannon, would you stop liking me if I got fat...?`
` I wouldn't stop liking you if you did."`
`"I, I didn't mean it that way...`
` I meant...if you don't take good care of your body, your health will...`
` au."`
`"Mother warns me all the time too.`
` Maybe I also need to take up Tai‐chi‐chuan or something to get some exercise."`
`"If you want to lose weight, it's best to start by reconsidering your eating habits, instead of doing intense exercise.`
` The exercise has to come on top of that, or you won't get any results, I hear."`
`"In other words, you're telling me not to eat cake, right?`
` Then, I guess I'll just have to gaze at you while you stuff your cheeks with that cake, Shannon."`
`"Uh,`
` er,`
` .........`
` ......Maybe one whole cake is too much,`
` ......but maybe just half of one would be alright.`
` Here, it's really delicious."`
`Shannon cut her own cake and tried to move half to my salad plate.`
`I had no doubt that she wanted to share the flavor of the delicious cake with me.`
`Even so, I deliberately and meanly pulled my plate away from her.`
`She blinked her eyes in surprise.`
` She couldn't seem to figure out if that was a refusal of the cake or not.`
`So I winked, opened my mouth, and said "aah".`
`"*giggle*.`
` This is what you wanted from the beginning, isn't it?`
` ......Gosh, you're such a pampered child, George‐sama."`
`"Okay,`
` say "aah"."`
`While still wearing an embarrassed, exasperated face, Shannon offered the cake to me with a fork.`
`Chomp.`
`It tasted like cheap chocolate cake you could find anywhere.`
` Still, it was exceptional.`
`Because eating cake in such an embarrassing way, as if we were the ultimate stereotypical lovey‐dovey couple, had been my dream for many years.`
`It made this cake's flavor heavenly...`
`If the Earth is destined to end someday, I wouldn't have had any regrets if it happened right then.`
`......It was such a moment of bliss.`
`After that, we gathered shells, ran from the waves, and enjoyed each other's company while walking along the beach.`
`In the end, the clouds never parted.`
` However, we both believed that our eyes were still reflecting a deep, blue sea.`
`".........Somehow, I'm so happy,`
` ...it makes me scared."`
`"You do say that from time to time.`
` What is it that you're afraid of?"`
`"...I'm...`
`......a servant of the Ushiromiya family.`
` For someone like me...to be here together with a member of the Ushiromiya family...`
` Um,`
` .........it just seems like too much for me."`
`"I'm also surprised.`
` I didn't just meet you today or yesterday, Shannon‐chan.`
` We've known each other for years now.`
` But we would only ever exchange greetings during family meetups, barely a few times per year."`
`"...I never imagined we'd become close enough that I could spend time with you like this.`
` It's the same for you too, right?"`
`"Uh,`
` ......I...`
`...umm..."`
`"Hm?"`
`"......I did...`
`...imagine.`
` No, umm, err!`
` Rather than imagination,`
` ......it was more like I was fantasizing......`
` You're always so considerate and gentlemanly, so I wondered, if we were in a relationship,`
` ......um, I just had fantasies of what it would be like......"`
`"Then, our relationship happened thanks to your believing heart.`
` Magic dwells in the power of dreaming.`
` So, I'm sure it was that magic that brought us together."`
`".........You're right.`
` ...I really think......that it truly was magic."`
`"But, you know, that's not quite right.`
` Every time we met, I saw you as more and more beautiful, and you grew to occupy a large space in my heart.`
` If the same thing happened to you,`
` then the fact that we are here today is simply an inevitable consequence, rather than something caused by magic or a miracle."`
`"...............No.`
` A miracle did happen,`
` George‐sama."`
`She stopped at the water's edge, and gazed beyond the sea.`
`" ......A miracle?"`
`"No, magic.`
` ...It happened."`
`I was bewildered by that slightly mysterious expression, which I sometimes heard her use.`
`"......Magic, you say?"`
`"Yes, magic.`
` .........You probably won't believe me even if I say it, so I won't.`
` But that magic definitely had the power to grant the miracle which brought you and me together."`
`"You mean, like a lucky chant to make your wish come true?"`
`"Perhaps.`
` Maybe it was something like that.`
` ...Except that it wasn't pretend—it really was real magic."`
`"...Hmm..."`
`Perhaps Shannon isn't alone in wanting to credit an encounter on a miracle, or on chance; it might be a universal thing all girls share.`
`For a man like me, an encounter with a girl is 70 percent effort to try to please her, and 20 percent raw courage.`
` And only 10 percent chance.`
`What she believes to be everything carries little relative weight within me.`
` ...Maybe that way of thinking is in itself calculating and typical of men.`
`But, were I to express that in words, any kind of magic would be broken.`
`I do think that to become this close has taken many fortuities, concessions, and great efforts from us both.`
`We have this private time together now only as the result of all those things put together,`
` and if she wants to call that "magic", that isn't strange in the slightest.`
`That's why I answered her the way I did:`
`"Yes.`
` ......If the same fate were repeated a hundred times, you and I might have gotten into a relationship like this only once."`
`"Our distant and formal connection could have continued right up to now, even as we both remained conscious of each other.`
` From the perspective of those otherworldly selves, we are undoubtedly in a miraculous relationship."`
`"It's not like that...`
` ......It really is magic."`
`"...Perhaps this is something that men will never believe, no matter how often you tell them.`
` Kanon‐kun didn't believe me at all, either."`
`"...I believe you.`
` ......Because I wouldn't want to break the magic by not believing in it."`
`"George‐sama..."`
`In a small voice, I apologized for making light of her magic.`
`Those words seemed to make Shannon a lot happier.`
`After all, if a pair of people believes in the magic of love, it becomes eternal.`
`"Oh, that's right.`
` I have a request, if you'd be willing to indulge me."`
`"...Yes?`
` What is it?"`
`"You know how you call me "George‐sama"?`
` It's not that I dislike it, but would you not call me that anymore?"`
`"Of course, you have to keep up your appearance with the Ushiromiya family, so I won't force you to do this during your everyday routine at Rokkenjima.`
` But, when we are alone, I'd rather you didn't call me that.`
` Yeah, let's create that rule."`
`"A, a rule?`
` Wh‐what would happen if I broke it...?"`
`"Good point.`
` Maybe rule violations do need to have some kind of penalty attached.`
` ...What should it be...`
` ......Wanna hear?"`
`"N‐no, I don't want to hear..."`
`"Ahahahahahaha.`
` I'll have to think about what it should be."`
`"Yes.`
` ......George...`
`san."`
`"...Yeah.`
` That sounds wonderful, doesn't it?`
` I'm so happy,`
` Shannon."`
`"I,`
` ......I...`
`...have the name Sayo...`
`......as well."`
`"Right.`
` Rules must be fair.`
` I'll abide by that too, and from now on, I'll call you Sayo.`
` Alright?`
` Sayo...?"`
`"Y‐yes."`
`I put my arm around her shoulder and held her close.`
`Her delicate body was pulled irresistibly towards me, and she leapt into my chest like a doll.`
` As I held her head in my arms, we looked at the horizon together.`
`"What a deep blue sea.`
` I'm so happy that we were able to see it together."`
`"......Me too.`
` It makes me very happy that I could look at such a deep blue sea with you."`
`As we gazed at the gray sea and a light rain began to sprinkle down,`
` we kept listening to each other's heartbeats...`
`The sound of waves soaked into my ears.`
` ...No, this was the sound of raging waves.`
` My body, bathed in painfully cold splashes, did not allow me to forget.`
`The memory of the day when my old fate was broken and smashed.`
`In the past, "tomorrow" had been literally like a mirror to me.`
`All I could see in it was the same me that existed "today".`
`{n}......My tomorrow would never be any different from my today.`
`That was my old fate.`
`...But at that moment, for the first time, I saw a different fate beyond the mirror.`
`The witch whispered.`
`She tempted me to take a bite out of the fruit of knowledge.`
`{n}She tormented me, saying that as long as I stayed in the paradise of God, I would remain furniture.`
`And so I learned of love, and decided to choose to become a person.`
`......Those days were like sweetly melting honey,`
` ......but then, I hadn't realized that they were the beginning of days filled with a new kind of suffering......`
`Taking a motorboat that I had just been told about, I made my way to this islet.`
`No, I couldn't possibly call it an islet.`
`{n}It'd really be more appropriate to call it a reef.`
`It had a torii and a small shrine for the local deity.`
`It was probably built to worship the guardian deity of Rokkenjima.`
`{n}......Even though I didn't know the exact meaning, I understood that it had a holy significance.`
`Despite being in a place like this, I took just one more look around to see if there was anyone observing me.`
`......The only things I could see were the stormy ocean, Niijima looming in the distance, and the waves breaking against Rokkenjima's steep cliffside.`
`I readied myself,`
` ......timidly approached the small shrine,`
` ...and took up the mirror that had been placed there.`
`It was an old‐looking mirror, dim and dirty.`
`{n}......If it were an ordinary mirror, that would probably give you a terribly bad impression of its value.`
`...However, since the mirror had been offered to this small shrine, that quality made me feel some kind of divinity from it.`
`......And I realized.`
`This was not merely a mirror.`
`{n}...Even if it was nothing more than an old‐looking mirror to a non‐believer like myself, in actuality, it was a mirror that had an important meaning.`
`......Is it really alright to break it after being captivated by honeyed words?`
`......No, this is no mirror.`
`{n}...It is the inescapable life I have lived until today—my fate.`
`Break it.`
`Break it, ......and seize a life from beyond the mirror.`
`{n}If I don't break it, my life will forever be a pair of facing mirrors.`
`{n}Nothing will ever change in the slightest...`
`The witch whispers.`
`She tempts me to take a bite out of the fruit of knowledge.`
`{n}Or maybe I have already had a taste of that fruit.`
`Because I ended up knowing those maddening emotions.`
`{n}Just as Adam and Eve felt compelled to pluck the fig leaf...`
`I can no longer...`
`...go without breaking this mirror.`
`I fought with conflict for many days.`
`{n}Inside my heart, the virtuous part of me and the part that sided with the witch repeatedly fought each other.`
`And now, here I am.`
`Did the part of me who is here win or lose?`
`There's only one thing I know.`
`{n}To obtain something, you must be ready to lose something.`
`The cowards who don't risk loss and never try to change anything will never be given the key to open the path to a new future.`
`The key is already in my hands.`
`It is—to break this.`
` To break it.`
`Is there any other effort I can make, as furniture imprisoned on Rokkenjima?`
`No.`
` There's nothing...but this.`
`Come, have courage.`
` I'll free myself from being mere furniture.`
`{n}And I'll accept my new sufferings, and become human.`
`{n}These are surely the small and large trials I must impose on myself.`
`Now,`
` ......break it.`
`Break the eternally unchangeable fate that imprisons me...into pieces......!`
`I raised it high,`
` .........thought back on all those days of conflict,`
` ......and, after a time far too brief to do them justice, I finished my reflections...`
`...`
`and threw it.`
`The thunder roared, ...crying out against me for my outrageous act.`
`{n}...It was truly the wrath of the angels, preparing to banish me from eternal paradise.`
`I looked down on the mirror tumbling at my feet, broken in two equal parts,`
` ...and, having made sure I had accomplished my task,`
` ......I looked up at the enraged sky, and screamed.`
`"...I,`
` ...............I kept...`
`......the promise...`
` ......Now,`
` .........it's your turn to keep your promise with me, right......?"`
`The thunder roared once more.`
`...I had already been banished from Paradise.`
`{n}So, I would have to struggle by myself in order to live.`
`The witch had said it.`
` That's the single element of the world.`
`To lose it—means to lose the world.`
`{n}...Like how a flask with a hole in the bottom can't be filled, no matter how much water you scoop into it...`
`"......I kept the promise.`
` .........Now, it's your turn to keep your promise.`
` ......Please, grant my wish!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐samaaaaaa!!"`
