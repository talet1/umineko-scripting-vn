`The biggest event for the Ushiromiya family in fall was the family conference in October,`
` but for Jessica, there was another one before that: the school cultural festival.`
`Jessica liked school; to her, it was a place where she could let out the stress she'd built up during the rigid lifestyle she was forced to lead at home.`
`For the cultural festival today, she had formed a group with her friends,`
` and would be performing casual pop‐rock on a temporary stage.`
`She had kept on preparing and practicing for that, and was really looking forward to today,`
` .........but there was one thing that had been worrying her.`
`She looked at the clock.`
` ...There was still a little time, ...but she was uneasy.`
`Would he really come?`
`As she was about to breathe out a stress‐relieving sigh, her heart jumped as all her friends suddenly started speaking in shrill voices.`
`"No wayyyy, Hina's boyfriend's a to~tal stud!!"`
`"He totally is, right?!`
` He totally is, right?!"`
`"Rin, your boyfriend looks hella smart!`
` So the guy's a hard S with glasses?! Like, for real?!"`
`"No way, no way, my man's a gyaru‐o!"`
`"""*giggle*{p:0:♪} *giggle*{p:0:♪}"""`
`......It's not necessarily the case that all girls are like this,`
` ...but at Jessica's school at least, the cultural festival was really a boyfriend exhibition.`
`Jessica didn't have a boyfriend.`
`{n}She had many friends of the opposite sex, but no "special one".`
`...But Jessica was a little famous around the school, and everyone naturally expected that she had a fitting partner.`
`Furthermore, her pride had caused her to act like that was the case.`
`Through such acting and dodging of questions, she had somehow managed to keep up the bluff until this year.`
`......But for various reasons, she hadn't been able to escape this year's cultural festival...`
`"Jessie~.`
` Is your boyfriend he~re?"`
`"Hweh?!`
` Ah, ah, no, looks like he's not here yet.`
` Maybe he's busy with work?`
` Ahahahahahahahahahaha..."`
`"What kind of guy is your boyfriend, Jessie?`
` At least give us a hint.`
` What type is he?`
` What type is he?!"`
`"Awesome, he's a working man, right?!`
` Is he gonna come in a suit?!`
` Of course he's gonna be sporting glasses, right?!`
` Kyaaa!!"`
`"Heeeeeey, but you don't really have one, do you?`
` If you come clean now, I'll let you join me!`
` Let's both flood this cultural festival with teeeeears!"`
`"No no no, I do I do I do, I'm telling you, I really do...`
` Ahahahahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`Jessica laughed awkwardly, covered with cold sweat.`
` ...It was extremely doubtful whether she really had deceived her sharp‐witted friends...`
`"Yes.`
` Then, how about making a fake boyfriend and taking him with you?"`
`"F‐f‐fake?!`
` Wh‐who......?!`
` I can't think of anyone...!"`
`Shannon's ridiculous plan surprised Jessica wildly.`
`Even so, it was a little more realistic than the unrealistic method running through her head of getting a boyfriend in a huge hurry before the day of the cultural festival.`
`"For example,`
` ......what about Kanon‐kun?"`
`"K‐K‐Kanon‐kuuuuuun?!`
` N‐n‐no way, no way!!`
` And anyway I'm sure Kanon‐kun will have work on the day of the festival—`
`I don't want to bother him and stuff..."`
`"Of course, I've already checked the schedule.`
` Kanon‐kun has that day off."`
`"......Wh‐...why are you always so clever at times like this...`
` No, wait!`
` It'd be even worse if he's off...`
` I can't pull him away from his precious break just for my own vanity!"`
`"If Kanon‐kun isn't pulled away, he'll always just be shut away by himself,`
` so I think forcibly dragging him around a bit would be perfect."`
`"Y‐y‐`
`......you think so?`
` ...No,`
` but,`
` ...I'd feel bad for Kanon‐kun......"`
`"Then I think you're out of options...`
` How about meekly confessing to everyone that you don't have a boyfriend?"`
`"...Oh, sure, sure, that may well cause you to experience some shame,`
` but you would only have to endure for the short and yet oh so loooong time before graduation.`
` To those couples in love, there's no sweeter honey than the face of a single person with an inferiority complex{p:0:☆}"`
`"Sha‐Shannonnnn~!!`
` You aren't really worrying for my sake, are you, you're teasing meeeeee!!"`
`Jessica wrestled about with Shannon, her eyes teary.`
`{n}But Shannon was unconcerned, laughing with her usual smile.`
`"Yes,`
` this is to get you back for making fun of me and George‐sama all the time."`
`At that comeback of Shannon's, the likes of which didn't happen even once a year, Jessica rolled around on her bed hugging her cushion, writhing and suffering.`
`Shannon's triumphant smile was unbearably frustrating, but right now, she was the only person Jessica could talk with.`
` She could wait until later to suffocate her with a cushion.`
`"Why not, Milady?`
` It's a cultural festival, but it's also a chance for you to have fun with Kanon‐kun."`
`"Well yeah, but...`
`ahh, nononono......!!"`
`Jessica buried her head in her favorite cushion to hide the fact that her face had grown bright red.`
`And she bit away at her thumbnail...`
`{n}...It really was a reaction to be appreciated.`
`Shannon and Jessica were about the same age, of the same sex, and they were also friends.`
`And they were both right in the middle of puberty.`
`{n}They could never talk enough about things related to love.`
`{n}That's why they were able to be open with each other about these topics.`
`So Jessica had heard in detail about how Shannon's and George's love was progressing,`
` and on the other side, Shannon had heard the details of what type Jessica liked, and what kind of man she might be interested in.`
`Judging by Jessica's reactions, it would probably be crude to talk about that in detail...`
`But we won't get anywhere with Jessica just rolling around on the bed forever, so—to be blunt—`
`Jessica had been thinking about Kanon ever since he had first appeared.`
`There were almost no young men on Rokkenjima.`
`{n}So maybe it was natural that Jessica, as a girl in puberty, had become interested in Kanon.`
`But if anyone said that, it would destroy the romance of a maiden's pure heart and of love at first sight.`
`Shannon had been with Kanon the whole time at the welfare institute, so she had known him before they had started working.`
`So Jessica had asked persistently about what kind of person he was, what his hobbies were, what his favorite foods were, what type of girl he liked.`
`.........Even Shannon could clearly tell that Jessica was infatuated with Kanon.`
`"Come on.`
` ...Isn't this a good chance to take Kanon‐kun on a date?"`
`"B‐b‐but but but...Kanon‐kun might also have someone he likes...`
` Wouldn't he take it badly if I made him go with me just to show off...?"`
`"People who aren't honest about their feelings, such as you, Milady,`
` ...what was that word again, I learned it from George‐sama.`
` That's right, they call them "{c:86ef9c:tsundora}".`
` Apparently they will be quite popular a few decades from now, you know?"`
`"Wowww, George nii‐san sure is incredible...`
` So, he's capable of foreseeing future trends now, is he?`
` Awesome.`
` ......No, wait!`
` You're saying I'm living in the wrong time period!"`
`"Waah, waah, waah, I'm dooooomed!!"`
`......Ultimately, Jessica wasted several days before finally agreeing to the plan of having Kanon pretend to be her boyfriend......`
`"......Yes, Milady.`
` Did you call me?"`
`Jessica realized that she had called him at a bad time, and immediately regretted it.`
`...Kanon always had a sour look, but even so, he had some good days and some bad days.`
`...Unfortunately, this reaction was the latter.`
`"N‐n‐no, umm, well,`
` ............errr."`
`"....................."`
`All that confidence and effort she had amassed by practicing in front of a mirror all night was wiped out in about five seconds...`
`Jessica turned bright red and hung her head.`
`Watching her, Kanon sighed.`
`{n}...Jessica thought he was getting fed up with her, and her face went pale.`
`".........I heard from Shannon.`
` Is this about me accompanying you to the school cultural festival, Milady?"`
`"Huh?`
` ......Ah, aaaaaaahhh!!`
` Nice, Shannon...!`
` ...I mean...!"`
`"Ye‐yeah, yeah.`
` Tha‐that's right, but, umm, err!`
` ...............Do, do you have any p‐plans that day...?"`
`"...I was strictly ordered by Shannon to work specially for you on that day, Milady.`
` I have never been to high school, so I don't really understand,`
` but I hear it's a place where girls feel very ashamed if they don't have a boy with them."`
`"...And I was particularly ordered to see to it that the daughter of the Ushiromiya family is in no way inferior to the common people."`
`"Waha...`
`wahahahahahahahahahaha, Shannon, I'll beat you to death laterrrrrrr!!!"`
`Jessica kept yelling with a strange voice, a broken smile, and steam pouring from her head as if she were a boiler.`
`As Kanon watched this, he sighed again.`
`Kanon wasn't an idiot either.`
`He fully understood what Jessica intended by inviting him.`
`......However, in truth, he found it nothing but bothersome to go along with the lady's game of love.`
`But Shannon had spoken to him persistently about it.`
` He was very indebted to her for many things.`
`{n}He couldn't refuse.`
`...And in his pocket was that brooch.`
`Couldn't this strange turn of events also have been brought about by the magic power residing in this brooch?`
`............Ridiculous.`
`{n}But those words of Shannon's came to mind.`
`...What did Shannon {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} that I cannot?`
`I don't understand Shannon's feelings.`
` We are furniture.`
`{n}...As if we could...become something more than that.`
`Jessica, still rambling on in a strange voice, and Kanon, sighing deeply, were a truly odd combination...`
`"Jessie, someone's here for you!!`
` Didn't you hear?!"`
`"Huh, ah, ah, sorry!!`
` Wh‐who...?"`
`As my friends all gathered together, ...they were looking this way with hard‐to‐describe expressions,`
` whispering to each other in low voices that couldn't be called low.`
`Even I felt kind of shameless.`
` Did I just say "sorry, who"?!`
`{n}Like I don't know who's shown up...!`
`{n}Aaaaaaaaah, crap, crap, crap, my mind is blank...`
`"Omigod, that's Jessie's boyfriend?!`
` He's sooo cuuuuuuuuute!!"`
`"She really had a boyfriend?!`
` No fake, serious, for reeeeal?!"`
`"Jessica, you traitoorrr!!`
` He's soo fine!!"`
`"He's younger?!`
` I never heard he was younger?!"`
`"Where where?!`
` Where where where's Jessie's boyfriend?!"`
`"She really does like young boys!!!!!"`
`"He‐hhhhhey!`
` Y‐you took a while, wahahahahaha!"`
`"......I didn't know where the entrance was.`
` I apologize for being late."`
`"R‐right, umm, ...that outfit suits you, doesn't it?`
` Wahahahahahahaha...!!"`
`"...Shannon...said my normal clothes wouldn't do, ...so we went and bought this yesterday.`
` It probably doesn't fit me..."`
`"Wa‐wahahahahahahahahahahahaha, that's not true!`
` Shannon, when I get back you're getting a posthumous two‐rank promotiooooon!!"`
`".........This place is kind of filled with girls... It's uncomfortable."`
`"Y‐y‐yeah, isn't it?!`
` C‐come on, let's not hang around here, let's go to the stage, alright?`
` 'Cause it'll be our turn really soon!`
` Come on come on come on!!"`
`It seemed that Jessica was just as uncomfortable.`
`{n}It looked like she was finding it difficult to cope while bathed in everyone's interested gaze.`
`...When he saw Jessica's appearance, Kanon thought that he might have made things difficult for her by coming.`
`"......I get the feeling that I'm getting in the way.`
` Am I a burden?"`
`"N‐no‐not at all, seriously!!"`
`"...If {ruby:boku:I} am in the way, please tell me at any time..."`
`((Kyaaa, omigooddd, he calls himself "boku"!!!!!!))`
`"Ahiiiiiiiii, you, you, you aren't a burden, Kanon‐kun!!"`
`(((Kyaaaaaa, she calls her boyfriend "kun"!!!!!!!)))`
`"......What should I do, Milady?"`
`(((Omigoood, she makes him call her Milady, like a butler, {ruby:omg:ktkr}!!!)))`
`"Nooooooooo, don't call me Milady todaaaaaaaaay!!"`
`".........Re‐...really?`
` Understood, Jessica‐sama."`
`(((Kyaaaaa, she's trained him to call her "sama"!!!!!!!!)))`
`"S‐ss‐sorry, Kanon‐kun, just for three seconds, could you close your eyes..."`
`(((Hiiyaaaaaaa, kiss, it's a kiss, she's going to kiss him!!!!)))`
`"O‐...okay, here goes."`
`BANG,`
` thunk!`
` BAMBAM,`
` SLAM,`
` CRASH!!`
`...When Kanon opened his eyes, for some reason, there was a horrible tragedy in the room.`
`{n}Everyone had been driven into the walls, their arms and legs outstretched.`
`Jessica put her brass knuckles in her pocket before Kanon opened his eyes.`
`"A‐anyway, let's go over to the stage.`
` Our turn is coming up soon, so wait in a seat for a bit."`
`"'Cause we have to get ready!`
` If you go straight to the end here, there'll be a temporary stage, so you'll know where to go, just wait there!"`
`Kanon seemed to be having a hard time adjusting; pushing him in the back, Jessica sent him out into the corridor.`
`Even though Kanon was confused by Jessica's attitude and show of agitation, which he had never seen before, he followed her instructions and headed in the direction she had indicated.`
`After seeing him off with an awkward smile, Jessica slammed the door shut and yelled loudly.`
`"There you go, you saw, right?`
` You saw, happy now?!`
` Wahahahahahahahaha, sucks for you!!!"`
`"......ugggggggh, I lost the bet."`
`"I was so sure that Jessie didn't have a boyfriend."`
`"That wasn't a boyfriend, right, she's just harassing one of her servants, right?"`
`"Waaaah, Jessie's boyfriend's incredibleeee...!"`
`"Sh‐sh‐shut up!!`
` Let's get ready, move it move it!!"`
`Jessica took the brass knuckles out of her pocket again, and everyone energetically returned to their tasks.`
`"...............haah."`
`Kanon went down the corridor as Jessica had told him to, and found a temporary stage set up where the vending machines should have been.`
`It was probably being shared in timeslots between the individual groups and clubs.`
`A student group was singing, and the place was already fired up.`
`Disliking that ruckus, he found a dark wall to lean against, alone.`
`......So this is what they call high school.`
`{n}It sure is noisy,`
` ...Kanon thought.`
`Then he remembered Jessica just now, acting in a way that he'd never seen before.`
`......Honestly, she was in such high spirits that alcohol might have been involved.`
`To him, the greatest virtue for a person was to always be composed and intellectual.`
`In that sense, it was very hard for him to get used to the atmosphere in a school cultural festival.`
`...He had the responsibility of reporting everything he saw or heard to the Master.`
`...So he would also have to report about Jessica's unrestrained behavior earlier.`
`......At the very least, it was not fitting for a daughter of the Ushiromiya main family.`
`The Master, Krauss‐sama,`
` ...and especially Natsuhi‐sama would probably be angry.`
`If I were to report it in a way that protects Milady, should I blame it on inappropriate school friends...?`
`".........What was all that?`
` ......So stupid."`
`Kanon thought back on how Jessica had acted earlier, and sighed again.`
`He could understand Natsuhi's headache a little now.`
`......Come to think of it, Natsuhi‐sama, as the president of the PTA, should have gone straight to a social after attending the ceremony in the gymnasium.`
`Hadn't she said that she wouldn't be there to see Milady's event?`
`{n}......That was probably for the best.`
`"............The crowds are unpleasant.`
` ...What in the world do they want?"`
`Several female students kept glancing at me.`
`It seemed they were all whispering the same sort of things that Milady's school friends had said, and it was really unpleasant.`
`Come to think of it, didn't Shannon warn me?`
`......That if I was going to walk around a school festival on my own,`
` I had better watch out because a lot of strange people would come and talk to me.`
`"He‐hello~, are you by yourself?"`
`Just as expected, a group of girls I'd never met started talking to me.`
`{n}Their stares started to make my back tingle.`
`......Didn't she tell me some magic words that could chase them off in times like this?`
` ...Ummm.`
`"......Sorry.`
` I'm with someone."`
`"Uh, oh, really...?!`
` I, I'm sorry!"`
`Ah, it worked.`
` Instant reaction...`
`Well, that got them to go away, but it hasn't really changed the number of people staring at me.`
`"No, it's that kid, Jessie's boyfriend!!"`
`"No way?!`
` That kid?!"`
`"I can't believe it, I was sure he was fake!"`
`"He's so cuuute, is he younger than her?!`
` I'm so jealous!!"`
`"...............haah."`
`...No way I'm ever coming to a place like this again.`
` Kanon sighed for about the hundredth time that day.`
`As he did, the lighting changed, and the standing audience started cheering.`
`Looking around, I realized that there were suddenly a large number of people here.`
`{n}And unlike earlier, they were all guys.`
`With this huge crowd, I couldn't even see the stage.`
` Fortunately, there was a fallen beer case nearby, so I tried using that as a footstool.`
`And I noticed that there was now a new group on the stage.`
`The leader was Milady.`
` She had changed into stage clothes, and was even holding a guitar.`
` ......I didn't know she could play.`
`No, maybe she could.`
`{n}I have seen her practicing air guitar before.`
`Natsuhi‐sama wouldn't approve of any hobbies outside of study.`
`Maybe she was always practicing in secret.`
`...Come to think of it, she's been returning really late from school recently, hasn't she?`
`...Maybe she's been practicing at school, far away from Natsuhi‐sama's prying eyes.`
`It really is for the best that Natsuhi‐sama didn't come.`
` ...If Milady were to get scolded by Natsuhi‐sama after putting so many hours of practice in, she would probably be very dejected...`
`"""Jessie‐samaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!"""`
`"Everyone, thanks for gathering here todaaaayyyyyyyy!!"`
`I could hear Jessica‐sama's forceful voice through the speakers.`
`...Jessie‐sama?`
` Maybe that's her nickname at school.`
`The students in the audience kept calling out that name.`
`{n}...I was a little aggravated by that inferior name, which was inappropriate for Milady.`
`Jessica‐sama was in great spirits as they kept calling her Jessie‐sama.`
`...They were all probably her fans.`
`{n}With her mike performance, she was responding to that and firing the place up.`
`{n}...It was almost like a song program on TV.`
`............At first, I had thought all this was frivolous, but that feeling now changed into appreciation—this was pretty incredible in its own way.`
`Kanon had never listened to music of his own free will, but he had often heard the kind of music that the people of the Ushiromiya family liked.`
`...Since that was almost all classical music, Kanon had naturally started liking classical music too.`
`...So to Kanon, the songs Jessica and the others were singing were...how should you say it...`
`.........very modern.`
`In any case, he thought that if Natsuhi‐sama heard it, she would probably faint.`
`But everyone looked like they were having a really good time.`
`The die‐hard fans, who had even brought pen‐lights, sang along,`
` dancing crazily with the exact same movements, almost as though it had been planned ahead.`
`On the stage, Jessica‐sama also sang enthusiastically, dripping with sweat.`
`.........He couldn't find a single element that was appropriate for a daughter of the Ushiromiya family,`
` ...but it looked like she was having a lot of fun.`
`"""Jessie‐samaaaaaaaa!!`
` Jessiiiiie, Jessiiiiiiiiiiie!!!"""`
`"Thank you!! OK, next up, we've got a brand new one for you! Don't Call Me An Ordinary Magician!!"`
`...I couldn't keep up with the atmosphere, but...`
`......anyway, Milady was full of life and looked like she was having a great time.`
`As I looked at Milady having a great time, I thought...`
`Isn't this what Ushiromiya Jessica is really like?`
`...Don't I know better than anyone just how badly life on Rokkenjima kills your own sense of self?`
`Then the time she spends, ...not as Milady, the successor to the Ushiromiya family,`
` but as a single girl called Jessica, living life to the fullest, must be very important to her.`
`...I worked close to Milady, saw her in all seasons, and I thought I knew everything about her.`
`...But that was only a single limited side of her, Milady of Rokkenjima.`
`......We are furniture.`
`{n}We serve on Rokkenjima, and end our lives on Rokkenjima.`
`...So I had come to think that Rokkenjima itself was our whole world, as though—just like in the old geocentric theories—`
`the ocean spilled off the end of the world into an abyss.`
`But as I looked at Milady like this, I realized that this was a horribly narrow outlook.`
`...I still couldn't keep up with the excitement of the crowd.`
`...But I felt like I had seen something that "cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}" on Rokkenjima.`
`.........Although I don't know if that was the {y:1:‘unseeable’}{n:1:unseeable} thing Shannon was talking about.`
`I still can't see the ocean as blue...`
`"Wasn't today the cultural festival at Jessica's school?`
` ...Has the principal been doing well?"`
`"...Yes, he seemed to be in good health.`
` Oh, that's right, Ms. Takamiya was also there.`
` She was particularly insistent that I give you her regards."`
`"Hmm, busy as usual?"`
`"It appeared so.`
` She is a very energetic person.`
` Oh, yes, there was also President Enomoto."`
`Naturally, the topic of Jessica's cultural festival came up at dinner.`
`School events often became social gatherings for influential people.`
`{n}It was the same for the Ushiromiya family, who were big names around this area.`
`As Natsuhi remembered the names of the important people at the social, she updated Krauss on the news concerning them.`
`...Jessica didn't really have any interest in that discussion, and rudely slurped her pumpkin soup.`
`"......Milady.`
` I would hesitate to call those appropriate manners."`
`"............Yeah yeah, sorry 'bout that."`
`"Jessica.`
` I am always telling you to do something about your speech."`
`"......Yes."`
`Jessica answered, discouraged.`
`{n}When he saw that, Krauss smiled a little and interrupted his conversation with Natsuhi.`
`"How was the festival for you, Jessica?"`
`"Huh?`
` Ah,`
` ......well, okay!"`
`"I was watching.`
` You did a good job."`
`"Huh, ......huh?!`
` Ah, ......ahahahaha, y‐yeah, I guess!"`
`Jessica's face turned bright red.`
`...She probably hadn't thought that Natsuhi would actually come to see her on the stage.`
`She felt a mix of happiness and embarrassment.`
`Actually, she hadn't wanted her mother to watch because she didn't want to be told that her music was inappropriate for the Ushiromiya family.`
`......But it wasn't as though it didn't make her happy to hear her parent say that she did a good job after watching her try her best...`
`"You appeared with both composure and dignity.`
` Fitting behavior for the students' representative."`
`"...ah,`
` ............oh,`
` ...yeah."`
`The smile that had been there a second ago crumbled like sand.`
`{n}...Jessica immediately realized that she was talking about something different.`
`Jessica was also the school's student president.`
`...She had no interest in something so annoying, but her parents had been pushy so she had grudgingly accepted.`
`Unfortunately, she was popular in school, so she had won the election easily.`
`So Natsuhi was praising her for the ceremony organized by the student council at the beginning of the cultural festival.`
`Actually, she had just carried that out halfheartedly.`
`{n}She had immediately met up with her friends, and had held a stage rehearsal for the rest of the time...`
`"The experience of standing above people and bearing responsibility will definitely be useful in the future.`
` It will surely help you mature as a member of the Ushiromiya family."`
`"But you spoke the greeting a little quickly.`
` You passed on content, but your fast style of speech dilutes it.`
` It would be good if you developed a habit of taking a breath every once in a while."`
`"............yeah."`
`After she finished eating, Jessica didn't feel like going straight to her room.`
`You could say that her room was the place where her parents had specified for her to be.`
`So maybe you could say that, for Jessica,`
` choosing not to return to her own room and instead disappearing to an unknown location in this large mansion was a meager form of resistance...`
`Jessica felt that even being in the mansion made it hard to breathe, so she went outside to the rose garden.`
`"...............`
` ...Well, even if she had come, she'd just have said something about how it wasn't appropriate for the successor to the Ushiromiya family anyway.`
` ...So what the hell's my problem.`
` Ahahahahahaha."`
`Jessica laughed at what she was sulking over.`
`...Laughed at what kind of words she would have had to receive to be satisfied.`
`......Ridiculous.`
` In the end, I'm just a spoiled little kid.`
`{n}I can't believe myself—it's almost funny.`
`"......Milady."`
`"wah!—Kanon‐kun...`
` D‐don't scare me like that, hahaha...!`
` *cough*cough*!"`
`Kanon had suddenly started talking to her just as she had tried to force a laugh, so she choked.`
`"What?`
` Something to say...?"`
`".....................`
`umm."`
`"......Yeah?"`
`Jessica's expression had become the one Kanon always saw.`
`{n}The listless Jessica from a second ago was gone.`
`If he still only knew Jessica as the successor to the Ushiromiya family, as he did until today,`
` ...he would have mistakenly thought that Jessica's mood had sprung back to normal.`
`......But that was wrong.`
`He now knew a part of her that he could not {y:1:‘see’}{n:1:see} until today, so he understood that there was no way that, on the inside, Jessica was just as she appeared.`
`"Ah... About today's cultural festival...`
` ...Well, thanks for coming with me so I could show off.`
` You really helped."`
`"......Your singing.`
` ...It was good."`
`"Wha?!`
` ......Ah,`
` .........ahahahahahaha?!`
` Re‐really? I'm embarrassed..."`
`Even though she had heard the words she had most wanted to hear,`
` ...Jessica became shy, and couldn't accept them frankly.`
`"......I cannot sing.`
` And I don't know how to play any instruments other than the harmonica and the recorder, which I learned in elementary school.`
` ...So I had just assumed that you were the same, Milady."`
`...Kanon hadn't been consciously looking down on Jessica to that degree.`
`But people playing unique instruments were always on the other side of the Braun tubes in the TV.`
`...He had got it into his head that it would be impossible for Jessica, at least.`
`"...I am furniture.`
` ...So I didn't believe there was any need to sing or play instruments."`
`But...`
`...I'm not sure anymore.`
`"......Kanon‐kun,`
` seriously, enough with that phrase "I am furniture"...`
` That's some kind of servant's mentality, right...?`
` That "servants should be living furniture" thing.`
` ...Genji‐san says it a lot."`
`"It isn't a mentality......`
` ...We really are...furniture."`
`"I know the kids from the Gospel House...receive assistance from Grandfather in various ways...`
`and I realize you feel gratitude for that."`
`"......But that doesn't mean...you should call yourself furniture.`
` Aren't you a human like us?"`
`"........................"`
`"Kanon‐kun, when you saw me singing, ...what did you think?"`
`"......It looked like you were having a lot of fun."`
`"That's probably not it."`
`"......Huh?"`
`"It wasn't that I looked like I was having fun,`
` ...you were jealous, weren't you?"`
`"...............`
` I......"`
`Even Kanon himself probably hadn't noticed that emotion.`
`{n}......Kanon had seen something he had never seen before, never known of before...and had probably become jealous.`
`And to trick himself about that emotion, he had called himself furniture over and over...`
`"I know I'm the successor to the Ushiromiya family or something,`
` ......and, well, I'm sure there'll be a lot of annoying stuff to do in the future too.`
` As far as that goes, I've just gotta resign myself to it—I was born under an unlucky star."`
`"...Probably, just like you had to live at the Gospel House, neither of us have a choice.`
` We couldn't choose the stars we were born under."`
`"...............That may be true."`
`"But there's one part where you and me are completely different.`
` ...Know what that is?"`
`I am furniture, and you are not.`
`{n}......He was about to say that, but stopped.`
`"...I don't know."`
`"Kanon‐kun, you think that your own fate is everything about you, and you gave up.`
` I can't accept this kind of fate, so I decided to do the best I can."`
`"......So as well as my normal constrained self who has to act as the daughter of the Ushiromiya family,`
` I've created another self who pours all her heart into the things she likes."`
`".........Another...self."`
`"Yeah.`
` ......Kanon‐kun, you've been telling yourself "I am furniture".`
` ......I'm sure there's been many tough things that have forced you to tell yourself that."`
`"...I think that's...`
`...really unfortunate.`
` .........But for that to determine your entire life, that feels so sad to me."`
`"................................."`
`"You know, people can always make another self inside themselves that they can really grow to like.`
` This isn't escaping from reality, okay?`
` ......When I'm that other part of myself, I can really feel like I'm living a great life."`
`"So no matter how constrained and boring everyday life is, I can definitely live without suffocating."`
`"......To make...`
`...another self that you can really grow to like...`
`inside yourself..."`
`To make another me, which isn't furniture...`
`Through her relationship with George‐sama, has Shannon given birth to a part of herself that isn't furniture?`
`......And did this other Shannon...see something that cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen} by furniture?`
`"Yeah.`
` .........Well, I don't know anything about your private life, Kanon‐kun.`
` But, ...I can sorta guess.`
` Your private life is...probably...nothing at all.`
` Bulls‐eye...?"`
`Kanon couldn't reply, but that was answer enough.`
`He had no concept of a private life.`
`So Kanon would always be Kanon.`
`{n}So furniture would always be furniture.`
`"......Kanon‐kun, that "Kanon" isn't your real name, right?"`
`The Gospel House gave new students new families and a new life, so it also made a point of giving each of them a new name.`
`......In his case, that was "Kanon".`
`".........Certainly, ......that name of mine may be a temporary thing."`
`He had thought that he wasn't anyone other than Kanon.`
`......But he remembered.`
`{n}...There definitely had been a part of himself that wasn't Kanon.`
`{n}But that was far, far away, beyond the distant fog of oblivion...`
`"So even for you, it should be alright to have times when you're Kanon‐kun, and times when you aren't.`
` ......Maybe the Kanon‐kun you are when you act as a servant calls himself furniture and strictly limits his own will."`
`"......But when you aren't Kanon‐kun, I think it's alright to live much, much more freely."`
`Those words definitely weren't just lip‐service.`
`Jessica had also been like this in the past.`
`{n}She had cursed her own birth into an environment different from all of her friends at school.`
`She had been the only one in a heavily constricted environment, forced to learn various things,`
` and she had even received words about the friends she played with.`
`......Though she had been sad about that, she had given up, thinking that she had just been born under that kind of star.`
`But one day, Jessica had stopped giving up and surrendering.`
`Stuff like the Ushiromiya family customs and pressure, those didn't matter.`
`She created a real "Jessica" inside herself, who could do what she really wanted to do.`
`"You know, I'm called by this nickname Jessie in school.`
` So when I'm Jessie, I live life honestly and to the fullest.`
` And because of that, I can do my best when I'm Jessica too."`
`"...Maybe you too could have times when you're Kanon,`
` and times when you're, umm,`
` ......your real name, and live a different way in each.`
` ......When you aren't Kanon, ...can't you try being another self who you can grow to like?"`
`"..................When...I am not Kanon."`
`He had thought that his real name didn't matter at all.`
`{n}So he had thought Kanon was all he was.`
`And now Jessica was saying that he should create a new existence, another self that wasn't Kanon.`
`"......Kanon‐kun,`
` if you don't mind, tell me.`
` ......What's your...real name?"`
`"................................."`
`He was silent for quite some time.`
`Maybe his real name had risen to the tip of his tongue.`
`...After hesitating for a long time over whether he should say it,`
` ...in the end,`
` ...he swallowed it back down.`
`"......I forgot.`
` ...My name doesn't matter anymore."`
`Those words signified a slight rejection.`
`"No matter what kind of real name I had,`
` ......the only truth now is that here, I am Kanon.`
` The past has nothing to do with anything.`
` ......Just as it does not matter the name of the tree from whose trunk a piece of furniture was originally made."`
`"......I said stop that!`
` You aren't furniture, you're human, you know?!"`
`"I am not human!"`
`Kanon clearly spoke his refusal.`
`{n}......It was with a rage that he normally didn't show.`
`Jessica couldn't say anything back, and was struck silent...`
`"...You are human, Milady.`
` So you are free to live any way you like,`
` and any kind of future is possible for you.`
` It's almost like you have wings and can dance through the sky like a bird."`
`"But I am not like that.`
` Even if you see me as a bird, I am nothing more than a domestic duck.`
` ......They may have wings, but they cannot fly."`
`"To speak of that dream of flight despite that,`
` ......that's just...`
`too cruel...!"`
`"...Furniture, ducks!!`
` What the hell is all this!!`
` ............No, ..."`
`Jessica had unconsciously gone along with Kanon's forceful manner of speaking, but she realized that she shouldn't fire back, and swallowed her words.`
`"...............I don't know anything about you.`
` I don't even know your upbringing, and I don't know the hardships you've been through.`
` ...So I can't even imagine why you started calling yourself furniture."`
`"......But know this.`
` You aren't furniture or a duck.`
` You're a real human."`
`"................................."`
`"If you want to say that the Kanon‐kun working as a servant is furniture, that's alright.`
` ......But, ...in that case,`
` ......don't you think you can make another self for when you aren't furniture, when you're human?"`
`"......Only a human like you can embrace that possibility.`
` ...I am not like that.`
` I have no future, no possibilities, and no dreams I am permitted to see."`
`"............So, Milady.`
` Please don't...`
`say any more...`
`....cruel things......"`
`"Why...`
` Why......are you saying that..."`
`"Because it seems that you are mistaking me for...a human just like you, Milady.`
` We are different beings.`
` I just wanted to make that clear."`
`"......I heard from Shannon.`
` Something about you taking a liking to me."`
`"Huh, ......huh?!`
` Ah, .........no, wahaha..."`
`"...I look almost identical to a human.`
` Therefore, .........like Shannon, maybe I could delude myself that I am human, and for a time, pretend to love."`
`"...But that would surely be fooling myself.`
` No, it would also be fooling you, Milady.`
` Shannon and George‐sama will definitely fall apart.`
` ...Shannon herself must understand that day will come, and yet she does this...stupid..."`
`"There, ......there's nothing stupid about it!!`
` Sure, George nii‐san's a brilliant person, and he's bearing both of his parents' expectations."`
`"...And yeah, when it comes to marriage, I'm sure Auntie Eva's gonna interfere in a bunch of ways, and, umm, I think they've got a really tough road ahead of them, alright?!`
` ...But you know, George nii‐san isn't the kind of guy who'll surrender to all that!`
` He won't turn Shannon into Juliet, he'll definitely make her happy!!"`
`"People and furniture cannot love one another.`
` ...I am trying to say that even if you can love furniture, I cannot love you, Milady."`
`"..................nn—"`
`Those words of Kanon's......crushed all of Jessica's bittersweet feelings from today.`
`There was no way she could have anticipated the emotions of such a blunt rejection...`
`In an instant, she lost the willpower that had caused her to try and unravel something stubborn in Kanon's heart,`
` ...and before she knew it, she was just standing there in shock...`
`"......Milady, if your feelings for me are due to my conceit, then I beg for your forgiveness."`
`"...N‐......no.`
` ...Well, uh, ...I won't deny it."`
`"......Thank you very much."`
`"Huh...?"`
`"For thinking of me as a human,`
` ...thank you very much.`
` Just those feelings truly make me happy.`
` ......And anything more would be too cruel, so..."`
`"No, tha‐...that's enough.`
` ...Umm,`
` .........sorry."`
`Jessica scratched at her head as she spoke, and tried to force her voice to sound bright.`
`"......I just kinda...`
`...ran on ahead by myself,`
` ...and caused you trouble.`
` ...I'm honestly sorry.`
` I'm really sorry...for using up your whole day off."`
`"No.`
` ......I was also...happy that I could see you having fun."`
`"...Then, let's be done for the night.`
` ......If I don't go back to my room and turn off the lights, Mom will get mad at me again.`
` ...Hahaha."`
`"That would probably be most appropriate.`
` ...I wish you a good night, Milady."`
`"......Yeah.`
` ............Good night........."`
`Jessica turned her back to him, and slowly trodded away, looking disheartened.`
`But suddenly, she started dashing pell‐mell, and disappeared in the direction of the mansion...`
`As he watched her go, ...for just an instant,`
` Kanon was tormented by the feeling that he had just made a huge mistake.`
`...But, no, he thought, this had not been a mistake at all.`
`......It was for her sake that he'd been forced to refuse her now, while her pain was still at its smallest.`
`"............Nice going, making a woman cry like that.`
` *cackle*cackle*.`
` I didn't expect you to refuse her that strongly.`
` ......Had you answered normally, another pair of lovers would have been born with my magic."`
`"How long have you been there...?`
` .........You're just horrible."`
`When he turned around, the witch was suddenly there.`
`{n}...It looked like she had been there the whole time, enjoying their performance as if it were a play.`
`"I shall forgive your reckless words towards me just this once in deference to that pleasant show.`
` ......Even after one thousand years, no more interesting show exists than complications between men and women.`
` To me, it's an addictive pleasure sweeter than any other.`
` ......nn?"`
`Kanon pulled that butterfly brooch out of his pocket.`
`{n}It was the crystallization of the great magic that the witch had bestowed.`
`Without hesitation, Kanon flung it hard onto the ground and stomped on it.`
`"......Hoh?`
` What is the meaning of this, when you know that was something given by me?"`
`"Just now, I figured it out.`
` ......What you are doing isn't as tasteful as being a cupid of love.`
` You are just a demon who enjoys showing love to those who can never be joined, and deceiving them."`
`"...............Hmph.`
` ...You are free to think that.`
` Most humans I have lent my power to have said the same thing."`
`"Don't play dumb!!`
` You didn't lend Shannon your power because you felt sorry for her.`
` ...You took advantage of a weak point in Shannon's heart as it burned with love, and made her break the mirror that sealed you.`
` And that's not all,`
` ...you're toying with her, when you know very well how it's all going to end!`
` Am I wrong?!"`
`"Hehheheheheh, *cackle*!`
` Furniture is a thoroughly pitiful existence.`
` So you have no dreams, no future, and even no love?`
` Good, good, there is nothing better than knowing your place.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`".........khh..."`
`"Just as you suspected, there was a faint love growing in Jessica's heart.`
` You are under the impression that you have snipped it out, harvested it."`
`"......But did you know?`
` Trees grow thicker branches if you thin them out, instead of letting them grow rampant. ......A girl who loves furniture, interesting, truly interesting!`
` Shannon and George will also eventually reach a stalemate with their unfulfillable love, and will bear just the kind of large fruit I like."`
`"However, to my regret, they've been getting on so well that it just isn't interesting, you see?`
` In that respect, I think you two shall entertain me greatly, *cackle*cackle*!"`
`The witch laughed.`
` Even though she had known that the two could not be joined, she had lent magic to join them together.`
`However, they couldn't escape the fate that made it impossible for them to be joined.`
`......The witch knew that.`
`Even if they were joined, the relationships of Shannon and George, Kanon and Jessica would fail for certain,`
` and as they wandered through the eternal desert in the hell of love, they would be tormented by eternal thirst...!`
`"Did you think I would lend them that power without any compensation?`
` I'll lend a hand in love.`
` And my compensation shall be one ticket to watch the cruel fate that the two of them will eventually meet.`
` Even after one thousand years, no better show exists...!"`
`"Just look at Kinzo.`
` See how he ended up, an old, pitiful man who knew the taste of love and was thrown out of Paradise!`
` Look at how he lives, like a dead man who can't fully die.`
` *cackle*cackle*!!"`
`"You really are a witch.`
` Get out of my sight, you demon...!!"`
`"......I shall disappear regardless.`
` My power still hasn't returned, you see.`
` It is still tiring to continue showing myself."`
`"......I overdid it when I gave you lovers my power.`
` ...As I am now, it will not be easy to maintain that power without that brooch as a catalyst."`
`Kanon ground his foot even more into the stomped brooch.`
`{n}He felt it break under his foot.`
`Then, it dissolved as if into water,`
` and changed into butterflies that sparkled gold, which fluttered away from beneath Kanon's foot...`
`"I also find it a little difficult to continue preserving this form.`
` As you ask, I will hide myself for a brief period.`
` Just as there is no tide that does not rise, and no moon that does not wax, my magical power will surely become whole again.`
` ...And there will surely come a time that is appropriate for my revival."`
`"......I cannot imagine whether that will be tomorrow, next year, or even one hundred or one thousand years in the future.`
` But as long as there are those that entertain me, I will surely gain power and revive.`
` ......I will disappear for a short while, until that time comes."`
`"The bruise on the palm of your hand is already gone,`
` so if you wish, tomorrow morning, you can let my existence disappear like an illusion or a dream.`
` ......There is nothing more saddening for me than to be forgotten."`
`"However, I will definitely be revived.`
` Make sure that you won't regret that day's coming at any time.`
` I will surely have my second coming and control everything as this island's true master.`
` ...And at that time, the door to the Golden Land will be opened again.`
` ...The covetous and the greedy shall call me forth without fail...!"`
`"...Enough!!`
` Disappear, now, Golden Witch...!!"`
`Leaving behind a mocking laugh, the witch turned into a flight of gold butterflies, and scattered away.`
`...The whole area sparkled like a gold blizzard in a snow globe.`
`It was a fleeting fantastical scene that disappeared in a heartbeat...`
`The witch could no longer be seen.`
` ...However, Kanon felt like he could still hear that shrill, unpleasant laugh...`
`......Aahh, how entertaining, how entertaining.`
`Why is the human world so entertaining after such a long absence?!`
`Go insane with love. Go insane with gold.`
`Those that don't go insane from those are not human!`
`I see, then the word furniture is fitting indeed, *cackle*cackle*!`
`Furniture is created to serve humans.`
`And I toy with and tyrannize those humans to ease my thousand years of boredom.`
`What a truly entertaining rock‐paper‐scissors situation, that I cannot control furniture!`
`Kinzo, your enterprises are truly interesting!`
`Furniture, try and see if you can hunt me...!`
`Tonight, two seeds of love have been sown.`
`...Including the one already sown, that makes three!`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}...`
` Why...did you leave me alone in this painful world...?`
` ......I detest you.`
` You are yearned after this much, and yet make no attempt to answer... I will detest you for all eternity!"`
`"My lord, drinking any more will be damaging to your health.`
` ...Haven't you also been warned by Doctor Nanjo?"`
`"Be silent, Genji!!`
` You do not understand, you do not understand my grief and sadness!`
` Even though I believed that as my oldest friend, at least you would understand my pain!!`
` Why is it so incomprehensible to you?!"`
`"Oooooohhh, {f:5:Beatriceeee},`
` why did you leave me alooooone......?!!"`
`"..........................."`
`"Uuuuughhu!`
` Hic, hic...!`
` What the hell is all that furniture stuff?!`
` What is all that crap...!`
` Uuuuuuuuuughhu!!"`
`"......Ohhh, how heartrending, Jessica‐sama.`
` ...Even though her crying voice that I can hear from her room tells me of the situation, there is nothing I can do."`
`"...This is all a tragedy due to people who are too young getting too close, when the positions of their birth are too distant.`
` ...I can do nothing but understand Milady's feelings, and walk away quietly with silent feet..."`
`"...Umm,`
` ...wh‐`
`what...`
`......do you mean by that,`
` George‐san...?"`
`"I mean what I said.`
` ......I still haven't built up my castle.`
` Once I have, I will be able to think of myself as an adult for the first time.`
` ......When that happens, I want to marry you."`
`"......Tha‐`
`...that's, umm,`
` ......err..."`
`"But,`
` my heart won't let me do just that anymore.`
` ......So I want to give you an engagement ring."`
`"En‐...engagement...`
`...you say...`
` But, umm,`
` ......I'm...`
` ......f‐`
`............furniture........."`
`"That's right.`
` And furniture has to listen to what people say."`
`"...I am currently having a ring made that's worthy to be a gift for you.`
` I think I'll probably be able to bring it to the family conference coming up soon.`
` I'll give it to you then, so please, I want you to let me hear your answer."`
`"......If you accept my engagement proposal,`
` I will proclaim right there, to all of the relatives, including Grandfather, my engagement to you."`
`"Geor‐......George‐san............"`
`"I'm sure some people won't approve of our relationship.`
` ...But there's no need to look at their faces.`
` ...Because you only have to fill your eyes with me."`
`"I will definitely make you happy.`
` That, I promise you, definitely."`
`I look forward to seeing how it will ripen!`
`The gold butterflies do not swoop upon the juice of overripe and rotting fruit.`
`I cannot wait for the day of harvest to come! Is the time of the banquet here yet?!{n}*cackle*cackle*hahahahahahahahahaha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}ha{0}hahaha...!!`
