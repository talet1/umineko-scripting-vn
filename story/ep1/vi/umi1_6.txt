`"So...on the tenth twilight, the journey shall end,`
` and you shall reach the Golden Land.`
` You really are diligent, Maria.`
` You did a good job taking notes on all of this."`
`"Uu!`
` I forget a lot so I write things down!`
` Write things down like Mama said!"`
`There was a notebook inside the handbag Maria was always carrying around,`
` and {f:5:Beatrice}'s epitaph was copied onto it.`
`Thanks to that,`
` we were all able to challenge the puzzle of the epitaph while here on this beach.`
`For Jessica and the others,`
` this was a puzzle that they had already tried to solve several times,`
` and had already gotten bored with.`
`But it was a first for me,`
` and I was so excited that I couldn't stop.`
` It really tickled my male sense of romance!`
`"Let's start with the first line.`
` Behold the sweetfish river, running through my beloved home of old.`
` Where was Grandfather's old home again?"`
`"I heard that, before the war, the Ushiromiya family had a mansion near Odawara.`
` So, that said, you'd want to know about a sweetfish river that flows through Odawara, right?"`
`"Yeah, because that river's the starting point.`
` And then it's got, you who seek the Golden Land, follow its path downstream in search of the key.`
` What rivers are in Odawara?`
` It's got to be one with sweetfish swimming in it."`
`"For sweetfish in Odawara, it'd be the Hayakawa.`
` It's famous for its mountain stream fishing."`
`"Uu.`
` I haaate fish."`
`"Ihihi, Maria, you'll understand when you get o~lder!`
` You'll be all, licklickli~ck, salty roasted sweetfish!`
` Yummy~!`
` Even though we just ate, I'm getting hungry again."`
`"......Umm, shall I bring you some biscuits?"`
`"Huh?`
` Oh, sorry—that's not what I meant, don't mind me!"`
`Shannon‐chan, who didn't have any afternoon chores for a while, was faithfully keeping us company.`
`I would have thought that, as a servant, accompanying us would force her to take care of us and tire her out, but it seemed that it wasn't so in her case.`
`...To the contrary, it seemed she was having fun joining in on the conversation with people of a similar age.`
`When I asked, she told me she was a live‐in worker.`
`{n}So normally, the only person close in age to her was Jessica.`
`I get it, that must be pretty wearisome.`
`"Alright, so I get that the sweetfish‐filled river near Odawara is the Hayakawa.`
` In that case, we have to go down it!`
` Don't you find anything if you head down the Hayakawa?"`
`"Ummm,`
` ............if you follow it downstream, you'll arrive in the ocean."`
`"Of course, you'd reach the mouth of the river!`
` And then the third line of the epitaph was "As you travel down it, you will see a village."`
` By the way, since long ago, the mouths of rivers have generally been key points for transportation, and large cities tend to be built there.`
` That'd be the next checkpoint."`
`"Hmmmmmm.`
` That's a pretty good theory.`
` Just like you imagined, in ancient times, there was a very prosperous old city there.`
` That's where Odawara Castle is."`
`"Ah, I think I might have gone to Odawara Castle on a field trip once.`
` It really was a wonderful castle."`
`"Yeah, I went to Odawara Castle too.`
` Even though I live in a Western‐style house, it sure is true that Japanese people feel calmer with Japanese style!"`
`"Uu.`
` I think castles are boorring.`
` Theme parks are better.`
` Uu!"`
`"I see, I see. Alright, alright!`
` If we find the gold, the great Battler‐sama will generously reserve a whole theme park for a day and let you play a~ll you want!"`
`".........Still, Odawara Castle.`
` The hidden gold of Odawara Castle...`
` Oho?!`
` Kind of has the right ring to it, don't you think?!"`
`"Hahahahaha!`
` Well, we figured out that much when we tried this two years ago.`
` The village down the river where the sweetfish swim in Odawara.`
` We figured that it was probably somewhere near Odawara Castle."`
`"The problem is the next line.`
` Alright, let's see where your strange reasoning can take you."`
`Jessica grinned broadly.`
`{n}It was like she was saying that, if the puzzle could be solved so easily, she would have found it long ago.`
`...Damn it,`
` I'll definitely find it and keep it all for myself!`
`"The fourth line.`
` ...In that village, look for the shore the two speak of.`
` .........I don't know what it means by "the two", but anyway, the shore.`
` .........What does it mean by the shore?!`
` Hmmmm...`
`is there any place near there with {ruby:shore:{p:0:岸}} in its name?"`
`"Ummm,`
` ......I have heard that there is a place called {ruby:Sogakishi:{p:0:曽我岸}} in Odawara."`
`"Huh?!`
` Wow,`
` you sure know a lot!"`
`"So~, what does that mean?`
` Shannon‐chan, are you also after the gold, and trying to solve the riddle~?`
` That makes us rivals!"`
`"It, it's not like I'm interested in gold...`
` It's just that...George‐sama told me about it before..."`
`"That's because we reached the same conclusion two years ago.`
` We even went and laid out a map and looked it up!"`
`"It was about five kilometers to the north of Odawara Castle.`
` There certainly was a place called Sogakishi there."`
`"......But after that, we get stuck.`
` The fifth line doesn't say where the key is hidden in that place.`
` Maria‐chan, could you read it for us?"`
`"...Uu.`
` ......There the key to the...`
`Golden Land...`
`sleeps."`
`"Uu!`
` I read it!"`
`"Sogakishi is probably large, and there wasn't ever any house built there by the Ushiromiya family.`
` With no hint to where the key is hidden in that huge area, we pretty much have to throw in the towel."`
`"You're right.`
` ...And without the key, we can't advance to the next line.`
` George‐aniki, what kind of place is Sogakishi?"`
`"I'm not sure...`
` I've never been there, so I don't really know, but according to the map, it's in the mountains.`
` I'm pretty sure it was at the base of Mount Asama."`
`"......Hmmmm.`
` Something doesn't sit right with me here.`
` Aren't puzzles for the hiding place of treasure meant to be a bit more exact than this?`
` I get the feeling we're barking up the wrong tree with Sogakishi."`
`"I dunno about that, Sogakishi looks suspicious to me!`
` There might be some house there that we just don't know about, that Grandfather lived in when he was a kid.`
` I mean, the first line did go on about his beloved home of old."`
`"...Shannon, Grandfather has you pouring drinks and stuff for him a lot, right?`
` Haven't you ever been made to listen to stories from his past?"`
`"......The Master almost never speaks of his past.`
` ...However, I've heard him speak of the Great Kanto Earthquake that almost destroyed the Ushiromiya family as though it had nothing to do with him,`
` so he may have been living far away from the Kanto area."`
`"The Ushiromiya main family may have been living in Odawara, but the branch families probably weren't limited to that.`
` Grandfather often called himself a branch of a branch family, and the least connected to the succession,`
` after all."`
`"So, in other words!`
` The beloved home of old might not even be Odawara at all..."`
`"I've never even asked about Grandfather's old home.`
` And he probably wouldn't give it away if I did."`
`"If the so‐called beloved home of old isn't referring to the Ushiromiya family's roots, then the Odawara theory is wrong from the beginning.`
` Of course, this doesn't remove all possibility that it was Sogakishi.`
` For example, he could have lived in Odawara when he was very young, but then moved far away later."`
`"Uu...`
` I don't get what you're talking about.`
` Uu."`
`Maria had been completely left out of the conversation, and she now sat puffing out her cheeks in boredom.`
`"Well, basically,`
` if we can't decide where the start is for our golden game of Chutes and Ladders, we can't even begin to play."`
`"...............But wait...?`
` In the first five lines the thing we're searching for is a key, right?`
` You can enter a door even without a key, just by busting right through it.`
` Can't we just throw away the first five lines and start figuring out the rest?"`
`"Ooh...`
` I hadn't thought of that."`
`"Oh well, we're just killing time anyway.`
` Let's hear the rest of your reasoning!"`
`"......But in the next part it quickly becomes disturbing..."`
`Shannon‐chan frowned slightly.`
`After looking back at Maria's notebook to recall what was written there,`
` ...alright, I agree.`
`"On the first twilight, sacrifice the six chosen by the key...`
` It sure does get horrible quickly."`
`"On the second twilight, it says to tear apart the two who are close.`
` Does that mean to make them break off their romance?`
` Or literally tear them apart?`
` I don't know, but either way, it's pretty disgusting."`
`"Even if we ignore the meaning of that second line, on the first twilight it's six people,`
` and on the fourth through eighth twilights it's five people,`
` so at least eleven people must become sacrifices."`
`"Uu.`
` Sacrifices to revive {f:5:Beatrice}!"`
`"...I see, sacrifices to bring back the witch...`
` I guess you can take it that way.`
` As a result, the witch revives on the ninth twilight......`
` ...This last part is glorious."`
`"............On the ninth twilight, the witch revives, and none shall be left alive.`
` ......So everyone dies in the end anyway."`
`"And then it's got the goal finally being reached on the tenth twilight that follows.`
` Not sure how anyone "shall reach the Golden Land" if everyone's dead."`
`"...It seems to allow for different interpretations as to whether or not the traveler who holds the key would be included in the "none shall be left alive" part."`
`"But there's something pretty interesting written at the end.`
` The lines about how, after reaching the goal,`
` four treasures will be given by the witch.`
` One shall be all the gold.`
` The problem is the next one.`
` It says she'll resurrect all the dead people's souls, right?`
` Doesn't it seem like this refers to everyone that died in the earlier lines?"`
`".........If you put it like that, the next one, the part about even reviving the love they possessed,`
` might be referring to the pair torn apart on the second twilight."`
`"That's right.`
` And the fourth one refers to the ninth twilight.`
` The fourth treasure is putting the witch, revived on the ninth twilight, back to sleep again."`
`"...If we interpret it favorably,`
` it's hectic with people dying and being broken up, but it's all made well in the end.`
` The awakened witch once again sleeps, and all that's left is plenty of gold."`
`"The witch must have her hands full with all this killing, reviving, breaking up, and reuniting people."`
`"Not to mention waking up and sleeping.`
` Hahahahaha."`
`"Oh well, just when the tale of the hidden gold was getting interesting, as soon as the witch's story is tied in, it quickly gets pretty shady."`
`"No kidding, ahahahahahaha!"`
`I laughed along with Jessica.`
`{n}After all, a witch was just ridiculous.`
`...Of course, once we started laughing like that, Maria, who believed in witches, got angry.`
`"Uu!`
` Witches are awesome!`
` They can do anything with magic!`
` Even kill.`
` Even bring back to life.`
` Even give love, even take it."`
`"Can fly in the sky, can become invisible, can even make gold and bread out of nothing!`
` Uu!`
` Uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Erk, oh no...`
` My bad...it's just a joke!"`
`Jessica apologized, sticking out her tongue, but Maria didn't accept it.`
`She grabbed her notebook back out of my hands, and, opening to the other pages, tried to prove that witches existed.`
`Those pages had colored illustrations of witches drawn on them,`
` and conveyed the fantastical image Maria had of witches well.`
`They were not depicted as the normal sinister crooked‐nosed hags flying around on brooms,`
` but as dreamlike people with mysterious powers, who could do anything and wore beautiful dresses—`
`just what you would expect from an imaginative young girl.`
`Dancing through the sky, crossing a rainbow,`
` dancing around all night with magical teacups and teapots that would never get empty no matter how much you poured out of them.`
`With a flourish of their wands, the stars in the sky would become candy and pour down,`
` and flowers that produced sweets would bud by the roadside.`
`......To Maria, witches were the sole thing that could give form to the magical dreams that so captivated her.`
`The last thing enriching her reality, which revealed more and more of its bland nature to her with every inch she grew.`
`That was why Maria believed in witches.`
`She didn't want that dream to be insulted.`
`{n}And for that very reason, nor did she want the epitaph, which affirmed the existence of witches, to be insulted.`
`Because the witch {f:5:Beatrice} {i:is} Maria's dream...`
`"To Maria‐chan, this is not something that points to the hiding place of the gold,`
` but magic to revive the witch."`
`So, it was the single bridge...`
`between Maria and the witch.`
`Maria was very angry and clung onto George‐aniki.`
`Jessica and I scratched our heads and apologized.`
`...It might not be possible to smooth things over again like the time she got mad in front of the portrait.`
`Maria didn't want to be easily consoled.`
`{n}As Jessica and I hung our heads, wondering what we could do, Shannon‐chan timidly opened her mouth in our place.`
`"Umm,`
` .........Maria‐sama, did you know...?`
` There is a ghost story about {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama that has been passed down amongst the servants."`
`"......Uu?"`
`"Ah, ahh, yeah, that's right!`
` Shannon, tell us about it.`
` I don't really know, but it's apparently pretty famous amongst the servants."`
`"What's this?`
` A ghost story?"`
`"Yes.`
` It seems it's a story from before we were born.`
` I've also heard it from my mother."`
`"......Yes.`
` It has been passed down since the mansion was built on this island.`
` ......The servants of that time whispered that the mansion had two masters, one of the day and one of the night."`
`The tale that Shannon told...`
`was just like a typical campfire ghost story.`
`If there was a forest with a witch living inside it,`
` ...then, inevitably, the witch was going to pay the mansion a visit.`
`At some point, this ghost story naturally sprouted up between the servants.`
`"Doors and windows they were sure they'd shut or locked would be open when they came around to double‐check.`
` Lights they'd definitely turned off would be on,`
` and lights they'd definitely turned on would be off.`
` Things would disappear from where they had been placed,`
` and things would appear when no one had any memory of putting them there."`
`"......When any of these things happened, the old servants would say that the witch had visited the mansion, invisible, and had played pranks."`
`"Uu!`
` See, she exists!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} exists!!"`
`"Yeah, she exists.`
` I remember often being unable to find my bag before heading to school..."`
`Maria puffed out her chest with an "uu‐uu" as though this was the final proof that the witch existed.`
`If I said it out loud, Maria would probably be hurt again, so I didn't, but...`
`...I mean, you hear that kind of story everywhere.`
`Depending on the place, it might be blamed on fairies or something.`
`{n}It's just that, on this island, they call it the witch.`
`Of course, you would expect that walking around a vast, elegant mansion at night would be a little unsettling.`
`It's an island devoid of people.`
` Since the mansion is so drafty, walking around on the night of a thunderstorm would certainly be eerie.`
`"In addition, some servants have also seen will‐o'‐the‐wisps and glittering butterflies dancing around.`
` ......Kanon‐kun also said he saw something like that when he went patrolling one night."`
`"And recently, the servants have been talking about strange footsteps inside the mansion near midnight.`
` We have whispered together that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama from the portrait sometimes makes herself invisible and walks through the mansion."`
`"...It happened a long time ago,`
` but I have also heard those kinds of footsteps while patrolling at night."`
`"......Whew.`
` That's scary..."`
`"Ah, ...but,`
` there's nothing to be afraid of, you know?`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is another ruler of this mansion separate from the Master.`
` So, she won't do anything bad, as long as you respect her and don't act oddly afraid."`
`"However, she's fearsome if you don't respect her, right?"`
`"...Yes.`
` I heard that someone who quit just before I began working, after falling down the stairs and receiving a large injury to their back,`
` had been speaking badly of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Because of that, there was a rumor between the servants that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's anger had been brought down upon this person..."`
`"Uu...`
` Anger will definitely be brought down on Battler and Jessica...`
` Uu..."`
`"I, I, I'm sorry!`
` I don't want her anger brought down upon me!`
` I apologize, Maria.`
` Of course, I also apologize to the witch.`
` I'm sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, please forgive an outsider's nonsense."`
`"I'll apologize as well.`
` I'm sorry, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` .........Will the witch be able to forgive us now?"`
`"...Uu.`
` Don't know.`
` Witches are fickle, so they forgive when they forgive, and don't when they don't.`
` Uu!"`
`"That's no good...`
` Maria‐chan, isn't there some kind of charm that could prevent Battler‐kun and Jessica‐chan from having {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's anger brought down upon them?`
` Maybe something to ward off magic?"`
`By relying on Maria, who was proud of knowing the most about witches, George was trying to revive her self‐esteem.`
`......I was once again forced to admire his ability to comfort children.`
`After crossing her arms and pondering seriously as to whether there was some charm capable of protecting Jessica and myself from the witch's wrath,`
` Maria began flipping through the pages of her handbook.`
`I had thought it was just a simple scribbled diary,`
` ......but it turned out that there were also many pages that looked like they had come from a book on black magic.`
`She was intently comparing several such pages, onto which had been copied what looked like magic circles.`
`.........It looks like that black magic hobby wasn't limited to Grandfather alone.`
`Perhaps she had finished her research;`
` she vigorously closed the notebook with a snap, threw it into her handbag, and began fishing through that bag's contents.`
`It seemed that various jumbled up things were in there.`
`For a while, she continued to take out various pieces of junk—although they were probably important magical items to her—`
`and repeatedly throw them back in, saying they were wrong.`
`She looked a little humorous, almost like Santa Claus deliberating over which present to give.`
`Finally, it seemed that she had excavated what she was looking for.`
`With a face unimaginably brighter than the difficult expression she had worn until now, she stuck "them" out to Jessica and me.`
`"Uu!"`
`As I reached out to grab it, I noticed that it was a very cheap‐looking charm.`
`It looked like a bracelet made from a plastic rosary,`
` with a scorpion‐motif medal attached.`
`I mean, you often find cheap accessories that correspond to the constellations.`
`It felt like a gift that you might win in the crane game at an arcade.`
` It really looked like something like that.`
`There were two.`
` Probably one for me and one for Jessica.`
`......However, considering the odd fact that there were two of them, they looked like cheap manufactured goods,`
` and it was quite hard to think of them as magical items.`
`"You're giving these to me and Battler?"`
`"Uu!`
` With these charms, even {f:5:Beatrice} is no problem!`
` Because the scorpion has the power to block magic!"`
`"Huh, really?`
` Didn't think scorpions could do that."`
`"Uu, Battler doesn't believe!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!"`
`I had inflamed Maria again because I said too much...`
`Maria took out her notebook again, and turned and pointed to page after page,`
` going on and on about how the scorpion had holy power, and had been drawn on magic‐repelling magic circles since ancient times.`
`"......Ah, I've heard about that from some of the other young servants.`
` Something about how the scorpion is drawn as a magic‐repelling symbol in sorcery..."`
`"Huh, really...!"`
`"Uu!`
` The scorpion protects against bad magic and disasters.`
` And emerald brings peace to the heart.`
` So it has double the effect!`
` Uu!"`
`"It's true.`
` The scorpion is wrapping around an emerald, protecting it.`
` I see, that seems very useful."`
`I really wanted to make fun of this worthless‐looking charm,`
` but as I watched Maria explaining the charm with all of her heart, and realized that she had prepared them out of consideration for us,`
` it felt as though, even if it were just a prize from a game center, it would still be beneficial.`
`Material quality isn't what's important about charms.`
` It's the strength of the feelings behind them.`
`{n}I'd like to think I have enough respect for myself not to make fun of those.`
`"Okay, thank you.`
` I apologized to {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama, but, even in the worst case where I'm cursed, I'll be safe now thanks to your charm.`
` Right, Jessica?"`
`"Yeah, that's right!`
` Thank you, Maria."`
`"Uu!`
` Wear it on your arm when you want a peaceful heart.`
` If you put it in your wallet, your money won't go down!`
` If you hang it from a doorknob, bad things can't get in!`
` A really useful charm!"`
`"What an incredible effect.`
` If it is a charm that Maria‐sama can recommend with confidence, I am sure it will be reliable."`
`As Shannon‐chan tapped her hands together lightly, Maria stuck out her chest.`
`She was completely cheered up again.`
`If it would keep her in this good of a mood, it would probably be worth it to let Maria lead the discussion for a while longer.`
`When you think about it, she hadn't shared in our excitement when we talked about the gold's hidden location, so I think she had gotten a little bored.`
`While eating the cookies Kumasawa‐san had baked, Jessica and I asked Maria this and that about black magic.`
`Maria happily chatted away in response to our questions.`
`For each one, George‐aniki and Shannon‐chan would act surprised and agree with everything she said.`
`The color of the clouds in the sky grew progressively heavier, but the cousins really enjoyed communicating freely after one year of separation...`
`"......Hm.`
` Did I just feel a drop on my forehead?"`
`"Huh?`
` You might have."`
`As George‐aniki rubbed his forehead, he looked up at the sky.`
`Considering the color of the sky and the dampness of the air, raindrops could easily have started falling down at any moment.`
`It also seemed like the wind had gotten a little stronger.`
`"Uu?`
` I didn't feel a drop.`
` I'm the only one.`
` Uu!"`
`"Calm down, neither did I.`
` Anyway, I'm sure that it'll rain so much tonight that everyone will get the same amount of raindrops."`
`"That's right.`
` Maybe we should head back soon...?"`
`Shannon‐chan looked down at her watch.`
`{n}It may already be well into the evening.`
`"Time to get back to work already?"`
`"Yes.`
` ...I enjoyed this time I spent together with you all.`
` Thank you very much."`
`"Tell Kumasawa‐san thanks for the cookies.`
` Alright everyone, help out with the cleanup."`
`Shannon‐chan declined our help, saying that this was a servant's job,`
` but picking up a dropped fork before the waitress has to is like my purpose in life.`
`We folded up the blanket, gathered up the trash, and helped clean everything up.`
`"Uu!`
` The trash is getting awayyy!`
` Uu‐uu!!"`
`"Oh no it isn't, I'll grab it before you!"`
`"Uu!!`
` I'm going to get it!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!"`
`"Mariaa!`
` Don't get your shoes wet, you'll get in trouble!"`
`To Maria, chasing after some trash that the strong winds had sent flying was just like an extension of our playtime.`
`By the time we finished cleaning up, the wind had started blowing very strongly.`
`It looked like a good chance to head back.`
`"You all really helped me out.`
` Thank you very much."`
`"...It really looks like you're out of time.`
` It's alright if you head back first."`
`George‐aniki perceived from her hurried appearance that very little of her free time was left.`
`"Genji‐san is very rigorous about time.`
` If you aren't at the right place at the right time, he can be very strict."`
`"We'll see you later.`
` Do your best with your work."`
`"Ye‐yes!`
` ......Then if you will excuse me."`
`After making a respectful bow, Shannon‐chan hurried off in the direction of the rose garden.`
`"Okay, let's head back to the guesthouse.`
` We can watch TV or something and relax a little."`
`"Uu!`
` Watch TV!`
` Watch TV, uu!"`
`"Then it's decided.`
` Let's all head back and watch TV together."`
`Even Maria, who was still not tired of playing, agreed when she thought about watching TV.`
`We headed up the gentle stairs and returned to the rose garden.`
`The wind had become very strong, and roses shook throughout the garden like ripples on water.`
`This might be our last chance to see these beautiful roses.`
`{n}Tonight's typhoon is sure to ruin them...`
`"These roses might be done in by tonight's winds."`
`"Yeah.`
` I'd say they were lucky, though.`
` After all, they got to welcome all of you before the typhoon."`
`"A flower will always lose its petals at some point.`
` However, because of that, we can admire them even more when they are in bloom."`
`"That's right.`
` ...Maria, burn this image into your eyes.`
` At this moment, they are the best roses of the year."`
`"Uu.`
` Burned into eyes."`
`Right then, Maria suddenly clapped her hands.`
`{n}It looked like she had remembered something.`
`"......My rose...`
` The typhoon will send it flying.`
` ......Uu!"`
`"Oh, you mean that unhealthy rose George‐aniki marked with a ribbon?"`
`It seemed that Maria remembered where the rose was.`
`She ran at full speed.`
` The rest of us followed her.`
`"............Uu?`
` Uu."`
`"Where was that again...?`
` I'm sure it was somewhere around here."`
`We searched everywhere around that area, but, after all, it was only a single flower amongst all of these roses.`
`Even though we knew it was somewhere close by, it wasn't proving easy to find.`
`The winds that made up the front lines of the typhoon were making the roses throughout the garden undulate.`
` It was almost like it was teasing us by making the location of Maria's rose impossible to find...`
`"Maybe it wasn't here...`
` Let's try spreading out a bit in our search."`
`"Sounds good.`
` Let's go for strength in numbers."`
`".........Hm?`
` What's up, Maria?"`
`As we made to split up and search, Maria tugged on my jacket with an unhappy face.`
`......It felt like her intention was to stop us from going to another place.`
`"What is it, what happened?"`
`"......Uu.`
` My rose is here.`
` It's here...!"`
`"But it's actually not, is it...?`
` Maybe it was on the other side of the flower bed.`
` If we all look, we'll find it fast, right?"`
`"Uu!!`
` It's here!`
` My rose is here!!`
` Look for it!`
` Look—for—it!!`
` Uuu!!"`
`Maria stomped her feet in irritation.`
`......She was pointing at the spot, saying it was definitely there, yet it actually wasn't.`
`And yet, if we went to go search elsewhere, she got mad.`
`...We were at a loss for what to do.`
`For a while, we would have to stay with Maria,`
` and pretend to search through this rose thicket.`
`"......Uu.`
` Uu...!`
` Not here.`
` ......Not here!`
` Not here!`
` Uuu!!"`
`Maybe she's saying that it should be here but isn't.`
`{n}Maria became increasingly ill‐tempered...`
`"...Oh man,`
` Maria is really losing her temper."`
`"Maria sometimes starts to really care about really pointless things.`
` If she gets what she wants, that's alright, but..."`
`"You can't find something that isn't there...`
` That's not good..."`
`Just as we were starting to despair for a way out of the situation,`
` Maria shouted out loudly.`
`"Mamaa!!`
` Uu‐uu!!"`
`In the direction she was waving her hand, Auntie Rosa's figure was visible.`
`Maybe she wanted to look at the garden one more time before the typhoon came,`
` or maybe she had some business at the guesthouse.`
`Auntie Rosa was coming from the mansion.`
`{n}She quickly noticed her daughter's voice and came over.`
`"Oh my, what happened, everyone?`
` Are you looking for something?"`
`"Look for iiit!`
` Mama, you look for my rose too!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Your rose?"`
`"We found an unhealthy rose around here and marked it."`
`"We tied a candy wrapper or something around it, tight.`
` ...But Maria, if I remember correctly, it was growing right in front and really stood out, didn't it?`
` Unless it grew legs and ran off somewhere, it must've been somewhere else.`
` Aren't you just remembering it wrong?"`
`"Uu!!`
` It is here!!`
` It—is—here!!`
` Battler doesn't believe!`
` Uu‐uu!!"`
`"For the umpteenth time, will you please stop that "uu‐uu" nonsense?!`
` Mama will look for it, so stay quiet!!"`
`I was a little surprised to see Auntie Rosa, who I had only ever seen as gentle, get angry.`
`Auntie Rosa began searching as well, so we went along with her for the time being,`
` but we were already more than sure that it wasn't around here.`
`...And so, Auntie Rosa also realized, very quickly, that it wasn't here.`
`"The rose isn't here.`
` Did you mistake this place for somewhere else?`
` There are so many roses around—"`
`"Uu!!`
` Uuuu!!!`
` That's wrong!!`
` It is here!!`
` Mama doesn't believe!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"I do believe you, that's why I'm searching!`
` But it isn't here!"`
`"Uu‐uu!!`
` But it is here!!`
` It is here but it isn't!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Then someone must have ripped it out!`
` Just stop whining like that!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Who ripped out my rose, who?!!`
` Give it back, give it back!!`
` Uu‐uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"How should I know!!`
` Stop it, stop that whining!!"`
`Auntie Rosa slapped Maria's left cheek with her palm.`
`{n}For that instant, Maria was shocked into silence.`
`Of course, it was only for an instant.`
`{n}When Maria realized that her wish was being rejected before it could be fulfilled, she started yelling with an increasingly louder voice.`
`"Uu‐uu!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` My rose!`
` My rose!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"Didn't I tell you to stop that weird habit!!`
` That's why all of the kids in your class make fun of you!!`
` Cut it out!!"`
`Once again, her palm slapped Maria's cheek.`
`This time she didn't go silent.`
`{n}She choked as she started crying, and began to bawl in an increasingly louder voice...`
`Auntie Rosa was clearly irritated, and lifted her hand once more to try and shut her daughter up...`
`"A‐Auntie Rosa...`
` Now, now...she's just a little kid...there's no reason to get so serious...ihihi."`
`I attempted to intervene with a forced smile and my hands clasped together,`
` ...but the deadly serious look I was thrown by Auntie Rosa taught me quickly that I shouldn't butt in.`
`"I'm sorry, would you all return to your room for a little while?`
` Your auntie needs to have a little talk with Maria."`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` Nobody believes in my rose!!`
` Even though it was here!!`
` Uu‐uu!!`
` Look for it!!`
` Look—for—it!!`
` Here, it was here!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"But it's not here!!`
` Then you must be confusing it with somewhere else, mustn't you?!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!`
` It is here!!`
` It is definitely here!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Then it has disappeared!!`
` Give it up!!"`
`"Why?!`
` Why did my rose disappear?`
` Why, why?!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"I don't know that!!`
` So stop saying "uu‐uu"!!"`
`Auntie Rosa once again raised her hand and, overrun by emotions, slapped Maria's cheek.`
`{n}It was so strong, it knocked Maria over.`
`"H‐hey...Auntie Rosa,`
` even if she is your daughter, you shouldn't be violent like that..."`
`I stepped between them to protect Maria, who was still on the ground, crying "uu‐uu".`
`......I know that problems between parent and child are none of my business as an outsider.`
`{n}But I wasn't brought up to just silently observe something like this...`
`"Don't you think it's weird, Battler‐kun?`
` Do you have any girls at your school that mutter "uu‐uu"?"`
`"Well, I am in high school...`
` But for an elementary schooler, I think saying "uu‐uu" is pretty cute..."`
`"Cute?`
` Saying "uu‐uu" is cute?`
` Cute?!"`
`It seemed that my reckless words had brought Auntie Rosa's wrath down upon me.`
`{n}She grabbed my collar with a terrifying expression...`
`"Don't say such nonsense!!`
` Do you know how old Maria is?`
` She's nine years old!`
` She's a fourth grader, you know?!`
` She's not a kindergartner!`
` And even so, she still says "uu‐uu" during class!!"`
`"Do you understand?!`
` This kid, do you know what they say about her when they bully her?!`
` Thanks to this weird habit, she still hasn't made even a single friend!`
` Don't turn your eyes from reality and recklessly call Maria cute!!`
` Think much, much more seriously about this kid's future!!!"`
`"Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!!"`
`"I told you, stop saying "uu‐uu"!!!`
` Didn't I tell you to stop it!!"`
`Auntie Rosa struck Maria's quivering head from which an increasingly unsatisfied voice was rising.`
`I tried to stop her, but she thrust me away...`
`My back collided with George‐aniki.`
`"......A long time ago, Auntie Rosa also thought of it as nothing more than one of Maria‐chan's baby words...`
`but she is now midway through elementary school, so the fact that it hasn't been fixed has bothered her a lot recently..."`
`"It's not like it matters what kind of words she uses..."`
`"You can't become a proper member of society like that.`
` ...So, even though it's not a pleasant scene to watch,`
` ......this is a problem between mother and child."`
`".........Well,`
` my mom's always giving me hell about how I speak, too."`
`If you look at it that way, maybe an outsider shouldn't interfere with this, even though it's painful to watch...`
`"Battler‐kun, didn't you ever have any bad habits as a kid that you couldn't fix and got you in trouble?"`
`"......Well, one or two.`
` On Parents' Day, I got a huge telling‐off in front of everyone, and it was so embarrassing, I couldn't stand it."`
`"Well then, you can understand Maria‐chan's feelings right now.`
` ......I'm sure she doesn't want us to be here now.`
` ......Do you understand as well, Jessica‐chan?"`
`"............I don't think anyone likes to be seen when they're being punished."`
`"Let's go.`
` Let's return to the guesthouse.`
` Then, after Maria‐chan comes back,`
` let's welcome her as if nothing happened.`
` ...That's...probably for the best, isn't it?"`
`We thought that George‐aniki's point was probably correct,`
` ...and if we could use that correct‐sounding reason to justify our retreat from this painful scene, that was probably enough for us.`
`Jessica and I nodded at George‐aniki, and we all left.`
`We called towards Maria that we were going to head to the guesthouse,`
` but since it didn't seem to reach her ears, we felt guilty and shameless even saying it...`
`"In that case, look by yourself as much as you want!`
` Mama doesn't care!!"`
`"Uu!!!`
` Look for it!`
` I'll look for it by myself!!`
` Look for it even if Mama doesn't care!`
` Uu‐uu‐uu‐uu‐uu!!"`
`"Have it your way!!"`
`After blasting her with those last few words, Rosa spun on her heels and quickly returned to the mansion.`
`Maria probably viewed that as a cold, hurtful gesture.`
`But from Rosa's perspective, that was not her intention.`
`...It was because the hand which she had so emotionally struck Maria's cheek with was still numb.`
`...It was because, if she stayed there screaming, she might again be taken over by her emotions, and continue slapping her daughter's cheek over and over.`
`After Rosa left, only Maria was left in the rose garden, all alone.`
`The wind began to blow stronger and stronger, and every once in a while, a raindrop would fall on her forehead.`
`...However, Maria couldn't leave that place.`
`{n}Not until she found that poor, withering rose.`
`It had definitely been there.`
` ......And yet,`
` it wasn't there.`
`{n}Even though she knew the place, and even though this was it,`
` it wasn't there.`
`Maria, while bitterly staring at the place it was supposed to be, thought frantically.`
`Maybe the angle I'm looking from is wrong.`
`{n}Maybe the height I'm looking from is wrong.`
`......While gazing at a single point,`
` Maria repeatedly changed her position and continued to stare.`
`The wind was getting increasingly stronger......`
`But Maria kept on looking for that rose in front of the flower bed...`
`.........Kinzo noticed the sound of the raindrops beating on the window.`
`{n}It had finally started to rain.`
`{n}It had begun later than the weather report had predicted.`
`Kinzo, as if being summoned by the sound of the rain, approached the window.`
`{n}The sound of the rain is a sound of silence.`
`That sound feels quieter than any silence,`
` and makes humans remember that, in the end, they are alone from when they are born to when they die.`
`"......You're late, {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`Were those words directed at the rainy sky...?`
`{n}No one could be seen in the direction of Kinzo's gaze.`
`"......So, shall we begin?`
` Our banquet of miracles.`
` ......In this very moment, this island has been cut off from the world.`
` Now there are none who can interrupt my ritual."`
`"There are many fitting sacrifices for you.`
` Four of my children.`
` Three of their companions.`
` Four of my grandchildren.`
` Me and my guests and my servants!`
` You may eat up as many as you please."`
`"The key of fate will select the sacrifices in accordance with the Demons' Roulette.`
` If that roulette chooses me, even I will become your sacrifice.`
` ......However, because of that...`
`because I will bet on that madness,`
` ......I will definitely create a grand miracle."`
`"...Come, devour as much as you wish...!!`
` I will overcome that roulette.`
` Yes, I'll put everything on the line.`
` First, I will return the headship of the Ushiromiya family.`
` Take it!!"`
`As Kinzo violently opened the window, he ripped the golden ring from his finger, and forcefully threw it away.`
`......At that moment, thunder resounded, giving the illusion that the lightning had accepted the ring.`
`"And.........when you are resurrected,`
` it will be me who stands there.`
` I will live until the end and watch over you as you awaken."`
`".........Now come, {f:5:Beatrice}...`
` Welcome to my banquet...!`
` In exchange for all that I have created, show me a miracle one final time.`
` ......Oooooohh,`
` ...{f:5:BeatriceeEee}............"`
