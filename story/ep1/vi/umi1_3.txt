`The four of us cousins were shooting the breeze over all kinds of topics.`
`After all, there are both girls and guys here, plus, we've got people over a wide spread of ages: adult, high school, and elementary school.`
`All each of us had to do was talk about ourselves, and it would be of great interest to the other three.`
`"I think I'm finally getting used to all this.`
` I mean, Jessica and Maria, you've both grown more than I could've imagined over the past six years.`
` So, to be honest, I was feeling a bit uncomfortable, but talking like this, I guess that on the inside, nothing's really changed since back then."`
`"Right back at you.`
` Even after six years, you haven't changed a bit.`
` Although your body's gotten gigantic, you're still a kid inside."`
`"Uu!`
` I'm a kid too!`
` I'm a kid too!"`
`"Well, you aren't gonna be a kid forever, are you, Maria?`
` I mean, you're gonna grow from being a kid to a cute young lady, aren'tcha?`
` And when that happens, that flat‐as‐a‐board chest'll be on Jessica's level, you kno~w?"`
`"When that happens, let me rub it, OK? Promise!!"`
`"Uu!`
` Let you rub it!`
` Promise!`
` Uu!"`
`"N‐no, Maria‐chan!`
` You can't make that kind of promise, that's bad, bad, bad!"`
`"Uu?`
` I promised, so let him rub it!`
` I keep my promises!`
` Always keep them, uu!!"`
`"...Mariaa, you're a really earnest, good girl...`
` The guy you marry's gonna be really lucky."`
`"Just a—Don't try to smooth over the topic with the promise intact!`
` Maria, that promise never happened!`
` Never!"`
`"Uu.`
` Promise cancelled?`
` Uu......"`
`"I realize now, it really didn't feel like a proper gathering of cousins without Battler‐kun in our group, did it?`
` These six years have been kinda lonely."`
`"...That's true.`
` We weren't able to goof off like this.`
` Still, we did have some pretty constructive conversations, don'tcha think?`
` Stuff about preparing for our future, exam‐taking, or finding jobs."`
`"Oo~ooh, I'm sorrryyy!`
` Now that I'm here, there's just this stu~pid babbling!"`
`"But, I'm having fun this year.`
` Uu‐uu!"`
`"That's true.`
` I agree, this year's the most fun."`
`Maria's sincere words probably spoke for everyone.`
`When George‐aniki stroked Maria's head, she giggled like a happy kitten...`
`"......Pardon me.`
` Your meal is prepared."`
`A timid knocking sound and an equally timid young woman's voice came through the door.`
`Jessica answered brightly.`
`"Shannon, come in!`
` You remember Battler, don'tcha?!"`
`Jessica stood up from the bed and opened the door.`
`There stood a servant girl who was definitely about our age.`
`"I‐it's been quite some time since we last met, Battler‐sama.`
` It's nice to see you after six years... I'm Shannon."`
`Noting my presence and trembling a little, she bowed deeply.`
`"...Woww...!`
` Jessica had me surprised, but Shannon‐chan, you've shocked me just as much...`
` You've turned into a total beauty too, haven't you~?!"`
`"Y‐......your words are too good for me......"`
`"Se~riously, the food on this island must be reeeally nutritional, no~?`
` What are you eating, where are you training, to get boobs that big?!!`
` Guess I'll have to feel 'em a bit and see whether yours or Jessica's are bigger, oka~ay?!"`
`With both hands poised and saliva dribbling from my mouth, I closed in!`
`......For the sake of my honor and justice,`
` I'd like to point out that I don't suffer from some strange disease that makes my lymph nodes itch until I scratch my neck open and which can only be prevented by rubbing breasts.`
`It's just my Battler‐style way of communicating.`
`When a boy closes in on a girl like this, nine times out of ten they get slapped or clobbered, right?`
`This is a Battler‐sama original communication technique, aiming for a gag like that to break the ice!`
`.........W‐well, that means I really do get to touch them on that one‐in‐ten chance though, right...?`
`Ihihyahyahya, I'd never ask for that much thouuuugh~!!`
`By now, my hands were less than a centimeter away from Shannon‐chan's chest, but......the counterstrike had yet to come.`
`She understood what was going on, and she was blushing and had her head lowered in embarrassment,`
` but she was just standing there with both hands politely joined in front of her, not even trying to resist or cover her breasts.`
`...Whoaaaaah, I wasn't planning on this!!`
`P‐pl‐please, hit me right now—at this rate I'm seriously gonna touch themmm!`
`...Which is why I was glad that Jessica chose that time to drive her elbow into the back of my head...`
`"Guaaaah, ooooowww, Jessicaaaaaa, thank youuu~!!"`
`"Wh‐wh‐why the hell are you thanking me?!`
` ???"`
`"No, no, my bad, Shannon‐chan.`
` Looks like I got a little too absorbed in your hypnotic chest...`
` No, more to the point, when someone gets that close, they've clearly got criminal intentions!`
` Seriously, you've gotta resist!"`
`".........B‐but...`
`......you are...an exalted guest, Battler‐sama......"`
`"Now look here, a crime's a crime whether I'm a guest or not!`
` Ten centimeters around a girl's chest is like an Air Defense Identification Range.`
` If someone trespasses within two centimeters, that's already an invasion of airspace and you launch a slap to the face on high‐alert!"`
`"............I, I couldn't do such a thing...!`
` We are.........that is, furniture, and..."`
`Of course she didn't want her breasts touched, but...if a guest so desired, she intended to sacrifice her own needs in an effort to accommodate them.`
`...A girl like this needs some urgent protection...!`
`"...I‐in these days, to think that there's a dedicated and virtuous girl like this...`
` It makes my head spin...`
` ......But, no!`
` No, no, nooo!!"`
`"I come at you with a perverted face!`
` You smack me down!!`
` "No~oo, pervert!"`
` You gotta complete the joke or it doesn't work! Please, it's a polite request, smack me!`
` Like this, smack!`
` Smaaa~ck!!"`
`"I............I cannot comply with polite requests.`
` Because I'm furniture.`
` ......But,`
` ............I will comply with it if it's an order.`
` ...Because that is my duty."`
`"Ahaha, then I'll make it an order.`
` From now on, if Battler‐kun tries to touch your breasts, you are to counterattack with a slap.`
` Alright?"`
`"......Y‐yes.`
` As you command.`
` That is what I will do from now on.`
` Battler‐sama, I hope you can keep this in mind..."`
`So Shannon‐chan declared, while bowing elegantly to me.`
`Her facial expression was radiant.`
`{n}I gave her a thumbs‐up to signal "you got it".`
`"Six years ago, you might've been mistaken for a servant's daughter who just came in to lend a hand sometimes,`
` ......but now you're a full‐fledged adult servant.`
` How many years has it been?"`
`"Well,`
` I've had the pleasure of serving this household for about ten years."`
`She's {p:0:紗音}.`
` ......The kanji for her name are read as "Shannon".`
`{n}This is another far‐from‐typical name for a Japanese person.`
`Being a kid back in those days, I had taken in her name without paying it much attention,`
` but for her to be called something like that is pretty unusual given that she isn't even a member of the Ushiromiya family.`
`...Maybe it's like a servant's "professional name" or something.`
`...If so, I can kind of understand why that Kanon‐kun's name sounds the way it does, too.`
`She's a long‐term servant who's served here since she was six.`
`Since her body had changed radically, she didn't match my memories, but we used to know each other six years ago.`
`It looked like she was just as shy as she had been in the past, but I got the sense that she had become imbued with the charm befitting a girl her age.`
`Especially her breasts, her breasts.`
`"That kid we met earlier, Kanon‐kun, is her little brother."`
`"...He's not exactly my little brother...`
` Still, he loves me like a big sister.`
` ...He didn't cause you any trouble, did he?"`
`"Haha!`
` He's the same as always.`
` It's such a shame that he doesn't act just a bit more sociable."`
`"...It seems Kanon‐kun has caused trouble... I apologize......"`
`"He didn't cause any trouble at all!`
` As a fellow man, I understand how moody you can get at that age.`
` It's no surprise that he's unsociable!"`
`"Uu!`
` I get called that all the time too!`
` Get called unsociable!`
` Like Kanon!`
` Uu!"`
`"*giggle*......Maria‐sama, you are not unsociable at all."`
`"Uu?`
` It was nice to be like him...`
` Uu."`
`"Umm, you said the meal was ready, right?"`
`"Ah, ......yes!`
` My apologies!`
` ...The preparations for your meal have been carried out, so I shall be guiding you all to the mansion."`
`Shannon bowed again formally and returned to her "duty mode".`
`We realized that if we made her stick around for any more light conversation,`
` it would actually make it harder for her to do her job, so we got up off our butts to avoid interfering with her work any further.`
`"Shall we go to the mansion, then?`
` You're all probably starting to get hungry as well, right?"`
`"Sure am.`
` I always look forward to meals when Gohda‐san's here cooking.`
` That guy, seems he was a chef at this famous hotel, so he's super good at it!"`
`"Oh‐hoh!`
` I'm looking forward to tha~t!!`
` Let's go Maria!`
` We're gonna stuff ourselves like pigs!!"`
`"Uu!`
` Stuff ourselves like pigs!"`
`"No, no!`
` You can't just take everything Battler‐kun says seriously, OK?`
` Because it's all jokes.`
` Come on, let's go."`
`Under Shannon‐chan's guidance, we headed towards the mansion.`
`Met once again by the magnificent rose garden, we continued onward as it came into view: .........the imposing mansion of the Ushiromiya main family.`
`It had apparently been built shortly after the war, so you could feel the dignity of almost a half‐century hanging about it.`
`On the surface, the building was gorgeous, but being as old as it was, it was seemingly lacking in modern amenities like air conditioning.`
`According to Jessica, midwinter was especially tough, what with all the drafts.`
`...Well, it's not like they couldn't just take the {c:86ef9c:kotatsu} out.`
`As we entered the entrance hall, an aged servant greeted us.`
`{n}Now him I remembered.`
`As the most senior member of the staff, Genji‐san ({p:0:源次}) served as the head of the servants.`
`"............Battler‐sama, we have not met in a long while."`
`As our eyes met, he saluted us with a composed voice.`
`He didn't give quite as refined a bow as Gohda's,`
` but it was a bow that had feeling, even if it wasn't polished to the same degree.`
`"Genji‐san, it's been absolutely ages!`
` You look well."`
`"Thank you, I have been quite well...`
` ......And you, Battler‐sama, I see have become a splendid young man yourself.`
` .........I would even say you have grown to somewhat resemble the Master during his youth."`
`"I'm looking like Grandfather?`
` I guess that means Grandfather was pretty popular when he was young, ihihi!"`
`".........From here on, I shall take Shannon's place and accompany you.`
` Please, come this way."`
`Shannon‐chan bowed deeply and saw us off.`
`Leaving the entrance hall, we headed to the dining hall under Genji‐san's guidance.`
`Genji‐san, just like Kumasawa‐san, stood in stark contrast to us young people who had grown beyond recognition over the last six years.`
`His figure was exactly the same as in my memories of six years ago.`
`{n}It seemed like time had stopped since the last we met.`
`Genji‐san was a silent and diligent person.`
`{n}He was like Grandfather's close aide or caregiver,`
` ......in fact, you could even go so far as to say he was Grandfather's right‐hand man.`
`Actually, it seems that he was by Grandfather's side more than my late Grandmother was.`
`According to Jessica, Grandfather trusts him more than any of his blood relatives.`
`But I wonder how long he's served.`
`{n}I've never asked for details, but I think I heard he's been here since the beginning, when this mansion was constructed.`
`...That is to say, he's dedicated half of his life to serving here.`
` ...No wonder Grandfather trusts him.`
`As we cut through the open‐ceilinged hall behind Genji‐san,`
`......I found something I had no memory of from six years ago.`
`It was an awfully big portrait hung right in front of the stairs that rose to the second floor.`
`Without thinking, I stopped walking, under its spell...`
`{n}Since I'd suddenly stopped, Maria, who was following behind me, ran into my back.`
`"Uu?"`
`"......Aah, sorry.`
` ...Hey, Jessica.`
` Did that picture use to be there?"`
`I pointed at the large and conspicuous portrait hanging in the hall.`
`{n}Everyone else stopped too.`
`"...Ahh...right.`
` When you last came here, that hadn't been hung yet, had it?`
` When was it again..."`
`"I think,`
` ......if my memory doesn't fail me, it was around the year before last."`
`"............You are correct.`
` In April of the year before last, the Master had this painting put on display, which he had instructed an artist to paint for him some time prior."`
`"Grandfather did that?`
` So, he went out of his way to have it drawn..."`
`The portrait depicted a woman in an elegant dress, who gave off a sense of refinement, and who seemed to suit the Western style of this mansion.`
`.........I couldn't have guessed her age, but the sharpness and obvious strength of will in her eyes gave me the impression of youth.`
`It was a different feeling than the composed mood of middle‐aged women that are often in famous pictures.`
`If this woman had normal black hair, I might have thought it was a portrait of my long‐deceased grandmother in her prime.`
`However, the woman in the portrait had beautiful golden hair, and didn't look Japanese at all.`
`"So.`
` ......Who is she then, this woman?"`
`As though trying to show off her knowledge, Maria answered that simple question with authority.`
`"Uu!`
` I know.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}!"`
`"Bea......what?"`
`"......{f:5:Beatrice}.`
` She's the witch.`
` Didn't you ever hear about her, long ago?"`
`"The witch?`
` ...You mean...`
`.........of this island?"`
`...I think I already said this, but Rokkenjima is a small island that's only about ten kilometers around.`
`However, considering that only the Ushiromiya family lives here, that's quite large.`
`So, only a harbor and the site around the mansion were set up to be lived in;`
` beyond that, the island remained as untouched as it was when it was still uninhabited.`
`To understand just how dangerous a vast and empty forest with no lamplight, phones or people passing through it at all actually is,`
` you need to shift your urban assumptions a little.`
`You see, if by any chance you fell down a hole in the depths of the forest and sprained your ankle...`
`cry or scream, no one would come save you.`
`If it then got dark, the forest, where there are no streetlights, would become enshrouded in complete darkness.`
`Also, since there obviously aren't any guideposts here, it's easy to get lost and lose your sense of direction in the dark forest.`
`Nowadays, most people see a forest as a peaceful place,`
` but to the people of bygone eras, before the light of civilization drove out the night, forests were like oceans on land, geographically separating one culture from another.`
`Just as fishermen who go out into the ocean occasionally have their lives put in danger despite their technical knowledge...`
`...technical knowledge was also demanded of hunters who went out into the forest,`
` and their lives were occasionally put in danger just the same.`
`...If a child were to go play in that dangerous forest, something terrible might happen.`
`Some parent must have had that thought.`
` ...Maybe my Grandmother, or possibly, the man himself, my grandfather might have said it.`
`Or maybe it was a story handed down on this island from long, long ago.`
`{i:.........There's a terrible witch in the forest, so you must not go in.}`
`Thus, Rokkenjima's ghost story was born.`
`{n}That is the legend of the witch of Rokkenjima.`
`So, when we say "witch" on this island, we're referring to the master of the vast and savage forest.`
`Which reminds me, when I was little and stayed at this mansion, during the eerie nights where the wind and rain struck the windows,`
` stories like "the witch of the forest is roaming around in search of a sacrifice" would scare the heck out of me...`
`{f:5:Beatrice},`
` ...huh.`
`.........As I searched my memory prompted by Aniki, I did vaguely remember being told that was her name, when I was very small.`
`"...Riiight.`
` Still, I completely forgot that the witch of that legend had an elegant name like {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......Goddamn, don't tell me Grandfather went out of his way to have her depicted in this painting just because us grandchildren refused to believe him?"`
`"......It's the witch from Grandfather's delusions.`
` ...Ever since he had this picture hung up, he's been losing the distinction between fantasy and reality."`
`"......To us, it's no more than the witch from his imagination, but to Grandfather, she's a being who "exists" on this island.`
` ......‘Exists’.`
` That's why he says he had that picture painted—so that we'd understand."`
`".........Hmpf, creeps the hell outta me."`
`"........................Milady.`
` ...To the Master, this is an important portrait.`
` ......I must request strongly that you not say such a thing in front of him."`
`".........I know that.`
` You couldn't get me to say it even if you begged me."`
`Jessica turned away, after glaring a second at the portrait.`
`"...Let's go.`
` We're making everyone wait in the dining hall."`
`"Uu!`
` Hungry!"`
`......Only a small portion of this island is controlled by the Ushiromiya family.`
`If all of the wild remainder...was the witch {f:5:Beatrice}'s domain...`
`......then one could say that she was the being who actually ruled over Rokkenjima.`
`That unsettling ominous feeling I had felt on the boat trip, when I learned that the shrine had been struck by lightning, revived within me a bit.`
`At that time, Kumasawa‐san had tried to tell an ominous story about Rokkenjima and had been stopped by Jessica.`
`.........I didn't know what she had tried to tell us about this island.`
`But, there was one thing I did know.`
`{n}...Rokkenjima's ruler was not the Ushiromiya family.`
`It was the witch, {f:5:Beatrice}.`
`{n}Yes.`
` ......Because this was the witch's island.`
`"Battlerrr!`
` Uu, slooww!"`
`When I looked around, everyone was already heading towards the dining hall.`
`{n}I hurriedly chased after them...`
`We walked up to the huge double doors that led to the dining hall.`
`Genji‐san knocked.`
`"......I have brought the children.`
` If you will excuse me..."`
`The door was opened and we were invited inside.`
`The dining hall, which screamed "filthy rich", featured a super‐long table which was obviously designed with no other purpose than to make the guests conscious of their rank,`
` and our parents were already seated at it in accordance with that ordering.`
`"You're late, brats.`
` Hurry up and take your seats."`
`The old bastard pressed us to sit.`
`Only the places where we would sit were empty at the long table, which only made us feel our tardiness all the more.`
`The seat at the very head of the table, which you might call the seat of honor, was for the most highly ranked, and reserved for Grandfather.`
`It was still empty.`
`{n}...He was probably planning to come in last to make himself look important.`
`The seating order, as you faced the seat of honor, went from left to right in rows of two, with the ranking being lower the further you were from it.`
`So, on the left‐hand side of the row closest to the seat of honor was the second‐ranked seat, belonging to the eldest of the adult siblings—Uncle Krauss.`
`.........It looked like he hadn't arrived yet either, so that seat was empty.`
`And then opposite him, on the right‐hand side of the first row, sat the eldest daughter of the family, Auntie Eva, ranked at number three.`
`The left‐hand side of the second row was for number four.`
`{n}There sat the old bastard, Rudolf, as the third of the siblings.`
`Opposite him sat number five, the youngest sibling, Auntie Rosa.`
`Going like this, you might think that the next ones to come would be their husbands and wives, but...`
`guess again, because the left‐hand seat in the following third row, meaning rank number six, was actually Jessica's seat.`
`Opposite her was George‐aniki.`
`Then, the seat next to Jessica was me,`
` and opposite me was Maria.`
`And next to me, on the left‐hand side of the fifth row, all the way down at number ten, finally came Aunt Natsuhi.`
`...Opposite her was Uncle Hideyoshi,`
` and next to Aunt Natsuhi, in the sixth and final row on the left‐hand side, was Kyrie‐san.`
`The seat opposite to Kyrie‐san had been laid out like the others, but was empty.`
`According to this ranking system, that spot was the seat where Auntie Rosa's husband should be sitting.`
`......He hasn't come, as far as I know, yet the table had been laid for his seat.`
`These kind of ranking orders usually permit the spouse a corresponding status, but the Ushiromiya family had an original kind of ranking.`
`......Maybe it's a leftover of male chauvinism.`
`{n}Under the notion that a mother's womb is only a temporary house for the child and she contributes no genes, the children of direct descent would have the highest ranking, followed by the grandkids.`
`Meaning that the spouses, with no blood ties, would be considered the last in line.`
`......It's terrible, but according to that ranking order, Grandmother, if she was still alive,`
` would be in a position even lower than mine.`
`In youth, obey your father; after marriage, your husband; after aging, your children.`
`A leftover of the times when they used to say, "Women: no home in three worlds".`
`Long ago, when I was still incapable of figuring all this out,`
` I'd thought it was so great that we could all chat with the adult siblings sitting in their group and us cousins in ours.`
` However, now that I can reexamine the seating order after growing up a bit, it stirs up some very complicated feelings in me...`
`Aunt Natsuhi, married to the eldest son of the family, responsible for managing the household, and number two for all practical intents and purposes, sat to my right,`
` ...which meant that she was two steps lower than me in the ranking order.`
`...It was difficult to guess what was going through her head.`
`{n}That's why I made a small apologetic gesture before sitting down.`
`"How nice to see you, Battler‐kun.`
` You've grown quite tall, haven't you?"`
`"Huh, ah, yeah!`
` Normal life—you know, food, meals, eating—then suddenly I was this tall."`
`"Boys do grow fast, don't they?`
` How tall are you?"`
`"I guess about 180 cm?`
` No, wait, you missed your moment, you're supposed to jump in with "Did you do anything besides eat?!""`
`"Huh?`
` ......Ahh, *giggle*, I'm sorry."`
`After a moment, she gave a small laugh, but it seemed she couldn't quite figure out what she was supposed to be laughing at.`
`This woman is Aunt Natsuhi ({p:0:夏妃}).`
`She's the wife of the eldest son of the family, meaning she is my dad's older brother's wife.`
`Is it easier to get it if I call her Jessica's mother?`
`...It feels bad to say it like this, but—not that I hated her—but I didn't particularly like her.`
`She never got into our kids' circle, and my only impression of her was as someone who always talked about complicated stuff with my parents while having a crabby expression on her face.`
`...The fact is, that having barely ever exchanged words, I hesitated a lot even just now about how to approach her.`
`...Aaand it was pretty much a flop.`
`The silverware had been tidily set up on the table, but the meal itself hadn't been brought in.`
`As a rule, the meal doesn't start until the man at the head of the table has taken his seat.`
`{n}So, as long as Grandfather—the highest ranked—didn't come, lunch would be indefinitely on hold.`
` Not even the appetizers would come.`
`In other words, this silence in the dining hall was the sound of our parents as they withstood their hunger and waited, on tenterhooks, for Grandfather to come.`
`Except—the Grandfather I remembered always showed up at the right time when we ate together like this.`
`...He wouldn't ever have been so late as to have everyone else waiting on him.`
`"Grandfather's pretty late.`
` ......As far as I can remember, he was always strict about staying on time."`
`"Well, maybe six years ago, yeah.`
` ...But not lately.`
` Seriously, he's off in his own little world now—he doesn't even show up at family meals.`
` ...I figured he'd at least stick around for today's meal, though."`
`"...That said, if he doesn't turn up, I'll be a hell of a lot more relaxed and happier to boot."`
`"...Jessica!"`
`After being scolded by her mother, Jessica faced the other way, sticking her tongue out.`
`......No way around it.`
`{n}Nothing to do but wait for the host to arrive.`
`When I glanced at the clock, I saw that it was almost twenty minutes past twelve...`
`The aged master of the Ushiromiya head house, Ushiromiya Kinzo ({p:0:金蔵}).`
`{n}He was there in his study.`
`The clock showed noon, but he didn't even attempt to get up.`
`With reading glasses on his face, he stacked up old‐fashioned books with elaborately designed bindings one on top of another beside him, immersing himself in their reading.`
`It definitely didn't look like it was for his leisure; on the contrary, he exuded impatience, crisis, as though every minute, every second were precious.`
`The sealed room was dense with dancing dust particles, and the air stagnated with a mix of smells of various elixirs, each giving off its own suspicious stench.`
`...They were somehow sweet, and heavy.`
`For anyone with a good nose, the first thing they'd do after entering would be to open a window and ventilate the room.`
`The knocking against the study door had been going on for a while.`
`A voice calling "Father" sometimes mingled with the knocks.`
`As Kinzo heaved a deep sigh, he snapped shut the old book he had in his hands, and slammed it on the table.`
`Then, he yelled at Krauss who was continuing to knock on the door.`
`"Silence!!`
` Will you not stop that noise, fool!!!`
` Who taught you that doors shall be opened unto you if you knock?!`
` They crucified that imbecile!!`
` Do you wish the same upon yourself?!!"`
`"......Father.`
` Today is the day of the family conference—it comes just once a year.`
` Everyone has gathered downstairs.`
` Please come out."`
`Krauss called out to his father through the door.`
`{n}...Kinzo always shut himself up in the study and hated letting even his family into the room.`
`For that reason, Krauss had no choice but to call out thus from the corridor...`
`"Molest me not!!`
` Everyone? Who is "everyone"?! You refer to the fools trying to drag me out of here?!!"`
`"Then kill them all!`
` Chop them up, make them into firewood, feed them to the witch's hearth!!`
` Put a pot in that hearth and boil wormwood!`
` And if still there remain imbeciles foolish enough to dare try to lure me out of here, force them to drink that broth of the Apocalypse!`
` Preserve the remainder in liquor!"`
`"Aah, Genji, where are you?!`
` Call for Genji!!`
` Have my demonic absinthe prepared!`
` The whispering of the green fairy reaches me no longer!!`
` Aah, where is Genji, call for GenjiiIii!!!"`
`...Before the door, Krauss, Nanjo, and Genji kept waiting for the master of the house, who would not come out.`
`"Hmph...`
` ......Looks like he hates me to his core.`
` My voice doesn't reach him anymore."`
`Krauss shrugged as though saying "It's no use", and smiled bitterly.`
`...He himself hadn't believed for a moment that his father would answer his calls.`
`{n}However, as it was the duty of the eldest son, he had formally made the request.`
`"......Kinzo‐san.`
` Your sons, daughters, and grandchildren have come to see you, you know...`
` How about you show your face, just a little...?"`
`"Shut up, be silent!!!`
` You dare admonish me, Nanjo?!!`
` I do not call for you, I said to call for Genji!!`
` Now hurry, call for him this instant!`
` Time is short—the apostles are already readying their trumpets—why do you not understand this, you foolish sheep!!"`
`Kinzo slammed the old, heavy book on the table over and over.`
`{n}The racket obviously indicated his highest displeasure.`
`Kinzo put his spectacles down and flew up from his chair.`
`He spread his arms wide open, as if to sing to a packed opera house, as if appealing to someone, and yelled.`
`"Why?!`
` Why is there always something in my way?!`
` I would throw it all away, I would offer up everything, and there is only one thing I ask in repayment!!"`
`"Ohh, {f:5:Beatrice}, if I could see your smile but one more time, I would plunder the smiles of the Earth and offer them all up to you!!`
` Oooh, commanders of the locust legions, reap the smiles of the Earth, *coughcough*, *haaack* *kofkof*!!!`
` Ahh, all is filthy, all is irksome!!"`
`"Why must I suffer this impediment on this most precious of days?!?!`
` *haaack*kofkofkof*!!`
` *cough*cough*!!!`
` Call for GenjiiIii!!!`
` *haaack*kofkof*!!"`
`"......I have no idea what he's yelling.`
` I guess he's finally gone nuts."`
`"Krauss‐san...`
` Isn't that a bit harsh, to your birth father..."`
`"My dad is already dead.`
` ......All that's here is a phantom of what he once was.`
` At any rate, as long as he lacks the will to leave that room, there's nothing we can do."`
`".....................Kinzo‐san."`
`Choking coughs continued to pour from the study...`
`"I'm going back downstairs.`
` ......It would be a waste to let that lunch Gohda's so proud of get any colder.`
` It's one of the few things the others have to look forward to here.`
` ...Hmph."`
`Krauss spun on his heels.`
`He looked at his wristwatch, mumbling and acting as though he had wasted time doing something he knew would be in vain.`
`"Genji‐san.`
` ......Father is calling for you.`
` Keep him company."`
`".........Certainly."`
`"Doctor Nanjo.`
` Let's go eat.`
` ......If we stay here any longer, even our sense of taste will go insane from this sweet smell."`
`Without waiting for Nanjo, Krauss went downstairs.`
`Genji urged Nanjo to go and eat.`
`...Nanjo looked first to Krauss's back as he disappeared down the stairs, then to the study door, and he let out a deep sigh.`
`"......Sorry, Genji‐san.`
` Please."`
`"Yes, ......please leave it to me."`
`"If possible, don't give him alcohol.`
` ......It's too powerful a habit."`
`"Is Genji not here yet?!!!`
` Who dares keep Genji from coming?!!`
` Ahh, where is Genji, call for Genji!!!"`
`"Now,`
` ......please leave it to me."`
`"...Mm.`
` .........Sorry."`
`Nanjo gave a small duck of his head and descended the stairs...`
`Genji saw him off, and knocked at the study door.`
`"..........My lord.`
` It is Genji."`
`"Genji!!`
` Why must you make me wait so long?!!`
` There is no one there, I trust?!"`
`"Yes.`
` I am alone."`
`Kinzo returned to his seat in the study and pressed an old‐fashioned switch on the table.`
`...After a small delay, the heavy sound of the door unlocking could be heard.`
`Kinzo believed that his family might try to break into his study.`
`Perhaps someone once opened the window for some air and scattered some important documents or something,`
` and that had made him extremely upset.`
`...Now, Kinzo had placed a secure lock in his room,`
` making it so that without his permission nobody could enter, and locking himself in the dungeon he himself created.`
`Genji, who he trusted the most, was relatively free to enter the room, but even that was not absolute.`
`If Kinzo was in a bad mood, even he wouldn't be able to enter.`
`.........Anyone else would be limited to holding a conversation through the door, not even seeing his face.`
`And most of the time, they wouldn't even get a real conversation.`
`However, that didn't pose any particular problem for the family.`
`That was because they had no reason to go out of their way to interfere with the retirement of the cantankerous and aged head; the fact that he was completely immersed in his odd research and always locked up in his hideaway was something of a benefit.`
`......They made the most of his refusal to leave the study, entrusting him to the hands of the servants, while they themselves kept their distance.`
`"Genji, my usual.`
` I'm busy."`
`"......Yes."`
`Genji headed to a corner of the study.`
`{n}There, suspicious‐looking bottles boasting venomous colors were on display.`
`...They were actually liquor, but considering that they were placed in this shady‐looking room, you could almost suspect that they might be ghastly poisons.`
`The inside of the study was filled with the mountainous library of outlandish books that Kinzo had amassed.`
`They were bizarre old books, some banned, and each and every one of them either forbidden, cursed, or sealed.`
`Of course, if one were to actually call them old books, Kinzo would fly into a rage and say something like this:`
`{i:"Call them...}`
`{i:grimoires!"}`
`There were candles which had melted in a suspicious‐looking fashion and taken on peculiar forms, and all manner of other strange objects, probably having something to do with black magic.`
`The constellations covering the celestial globe would have caused anyone who knew the night sky well to raise an eyebrow.`
`The illustrations inscribed in old books, haphazardly left open, ranged from the religious and mystical...`
`to the demonic and grotesque, as well as bizarre diagrams of various magic circles.`
`And above all, the sweet, poisonous smell that filled the room,`
` which to those entering for the first time would surely be a profound assault on their sense of sight, smell, and all their other senses, making them lose their grip on reality...`
`Inside that study, Genji, with his well trained hand, prepared Kinzo's usual drink.`
`If you didn't know that the ghastly dark green liquid that filled the complexly designed bottle was liquor, you certainly wouldn't want to put it in your mouth.`
`......He poured a small quantity of the spirit into the glass,`
` placed a cube of sugar in a strangely shaped spoon, and then poured water from a pitcher over it.`
`Strangely, when the colorless water was poured into it, the dark green liquid turned a cloudy white.`
`...It created the strange visual illusion that the water had caused a chemical reaction, which made it all the more difficult to perceive the concoction as liquor.`
`To this, he added an original flavoring that Kinzo liked, and fine‐tuned the taste.`
`...There was no recipe.`
` Its success was measured only by Kinzo's mood swing when he drank it, and he had learned how to make it only after many decades.`
`Genji placed the glass on a tray, and made his way over to Kinzo.`
`{n}Kinzo was now gazing out the window.`
`".........As you asked, my lord."`
`"Thank you..."`
`Kinzo had regained his composure—so much so that he was now unrecognizable as the man who had been shouting, screaming and yelling just moments before.`
`In that man's back dwelt a dignity and intelligence made plain simply by how he tilted his glass and gazed down at the scenery beyond the window.`
`Genji, in order to allow Kinzo to set down his glass any time,`
` motionlessly waited behind and to his left, as though he were a living sideboard.`
` As he did, Kinzo stuck out just the glass, his gaze still directed at the world outside the window.`
`There was just a mouthful remaining.`
`It was not a gesture intended to set it upon the tray, as Genji expected, but was a motion to hand the glass over to Genji.`
`"......Drink it.`
` ...My friend."`
`".....................That is more than I deserve."`
`"No need for ceremony between us.`
` ......Drink it.`
` Friend."`
`"...............Thank you."`
`Genji respectfully received the glass and inclined it a little to taste its contents.`
`Then, he downed it in one gulp.`
`"I attempted to imitate your concoction, but no matter how I try, I cannot replicate the taste.`
` ......The way you make it is pure relish."`
`".........Thank you very much.`
` It is the fruit of your guidance, my lord."`
`"Hmph..."`
`Kinzo smiled at his loyal subject who refused to put aside rank even when asked to.`
`However, he was not making fun of him; it was relaxed, like a smile at a close friend's unriddable bad habit.`
`".........We have grown old, you and I.`
` I forgot my age a long time ago."`
`"That I was permitted to live the life I have until today has all been thanks to you, my lord."`
`Kinzo gave a thin smile, as if to say he didn't need compliments.`
`".........You have served me exceedingly well these years.`
` ......My sons call me eccentric.`
` The servants that were once many, all of them, retired in their growing fear of me.`
` ......Only you, even now, serve me."`
`"...That is more than I deserve."`
`".........I doubt I have much time left to live.`
` ......My sons are vultures, lazily waiting for my inheritance to fall into their hands."`
`"........................"`
`"That fool Krauss squanders money like water, throws away two gold coins to obtain one.`
` With that, he deludes himself into saying he earned money!!`
` Eva is a slave to money, thinking of me as a hen or whatnot!!`
` As if when I die, she'll even use my carcass to make broth!!"`
`"That dunce Rudolf just wants to fool around with women!!`
` Rosa bore the baby of a nobody!!`
` Jessica is incompetent and illiterate!!`
` George has none of what it takes to be a man!`
` Battler is a fool who threw away the honor of the Ushiromiya family!!`
` And Maria is obscene to the eye!!"`
`"Why, why is the Ushiromiya blood so incompetent?!!`
` Is there anyone worthy to inherit the glory I built?!`
` Ahh, of course, I know, this is {f:5:Beatrice}'s curse, I know it!!`
` ...Aah, Golden Witch, is this supposed to be your revenge against me?"`
`"Hate me if you wish!`
` Run away if you wish!!`
` I won't let you go, I won't let you go won't let you go won't let you go!!`
` You are mine!!`
` You cannot be anywhere but in my arms!`
` You are my entire life!"`
`"You'll continue to whisper for all eternity in my bird cage to me, only to me!!`
` {f:5:Beatrice}......`
` Why...won't you give me back your smile...`
` OOOoooooh, OOOooOOOoooh...!!`
` {f:5:BeatriceeEeEEeeEee}!!`
` OOOoooOOOOoohh......"`
`After howling, Kinzo choked once again.`
`{n}Genji set the tray and the glass down and patted his master's back...`
`Genji's facial expression did not change.`
`{n}.........It was always like this.`
`"............*cough*...`
` Hmhm.`
` ............Thank you, my friend."`
`"........................"`
`After his almost deranged outburst of the past few minutes settled down, Kinzo regained his composure once more.`
`...The way his attitude changed was like seeing two different people, a wild Kinzo and a composed Kinzo, living together inside one body.`
`"And so,`
` ......I have decided.`
` .....................I cannot stand spending the insipid remainder of my life procrastinating like this.`
` If I have any final coins left to gamble, then I choose to abandon them all to the whims of the Demons' Roulette."`
`"......The power of magic is always determined by the risk staked upon it.`
` Like visiting a shrine at the Hour of the Ox in ancient Japanese sorcery, to nail a curse doll to a tree.`
` The magic power dwells in incurring the risk that it will be seen before seven days pass.`
` The more dangerous the risk, the stronger the magic power will be."`
`"All the various miracles that appear in myth can be called crystals of astonishing magic power, obtained through miraculously low probabilities and astronomical risks!"`
`"That Moses parted the sea was no miracle of God's—`
`it was that utterly desperate risk, weighed upon the scales of oppression, of being cornered by soldiers on the Red Sea's shores, which gave birth to miraculous magic power!`
` Even if the same thing occurs again, on the same scope, the sea will no doubt not part."`
`"That is because Moses managed to spectacularly draw out the single miracle carved in the roulette of those in power, which has more pockets than {c:86EF9C:asougi (10⁵⁶) and nayuta (10⁶⁰)} multiplied together."`
`"The power to triumph over astronomical odds!!`
` Yes, magical power is, in other words, having the luck to grasp miracles!!`
` To obtain great magical power, one must bear a risk that is hopelessly great!!`
` Those who possess no magic would call this not a bet, but pure desperation!"`
`"However, those who truly do possess magical power can grasp hold of that miracle and make the enigma come into being!!`
` And if that power exists within me!`
` I will seize that miracle, I will be able to make the wish I devoted my life towards come true!!"`
`Kinzo looked up to the sky outside the window.`
`{n}He spread his arms as if appealing to someone up in the skies.`
`"And if...!!!`
` If I were to have what it takes to obtain that miracle...!!`
` .........Oooh...`
`{f:5:Beatrice}...`
`{f:5:Beatrice}...`
` Show me your lovely smile once more..."`
`"No matter how much time passes, your face does not vanish...`
` I just want to see your smile...that is all...!`
` I'll return everything you granted me!`
` I'll return all the glory I've gained since that day!`
` I don't need fortune, prestige, gold!!`
` I'll return everything you granted me!!"`
`"I just want to see your smile!!`
` I beg of you, {f:5:Beatrice}!!`
` OOOoooooOooh...oOoOOoh...ooh...!!"`
`......His nonsensical yells segued into a scream, ...and then into a wail.`
`Kinzo crumpled onto the floor, and clawed at it with both hands.`
`Genji had no choice but to wordlessly watch over his master's lament...`
`"Well, ladies and gentlemen.`
` ......The head of the family is not in his best shape.`
` He considers it a great shame that he will not be able to partake in lunch with you all, you having assembled especially for this long‐awaited yearly meeting."`
`"......Gohda, let the lunch begin."`
`"Certainly. Well then, ladies and gentlemen, we shall begin today's luncheon."`
`"......Doctor Nanjo, is Father's condition that bad?`
` Surely he could have at least showed his face?"`
`"Rather than his physical condition, it's his mood...`
` And for that, there is no medicine I can prescribe."`
`"Oh, come on, for God's sake, "mood", again?`
` We come to hear how he's doing, making time in our schedules in this damn busy season of autumn.`
` That's just—"`
`"Hmph...then you got what you wanted, Rudolf.`
` You managed to {i:hear how he's doing}.`
` ......Or do you want to take my place, and try to persuade our ill‐humored father to come join us?"`
`"............Are you kidding?"`
`Rudolf shrugged.`
`Apparently, even though Rudolf seemed to resent the way his father did whatever he pleased, he'd rather avoid seeing his face if he could help it.`
`"Does it seem like his mood will improve before dinner?`
` Krauss nii‐san?"`
`"I have no idea.`
` You can try to ask Father directly.`
` ...Although, I think his mood will improve faster if we don't bother him."`
`"The only one who can bring Grandfather's temper under control is Genji‐san.`
` Pretty damn pathetic when you have to have a servant to deal with your own parent's bad mood."`
`"Jessica.`
` Don't speak out of turn."`
`She'd planned for her complaint to be heard only by her cousins, but it had reached even Krauss's ears.`
`Scolded, Jessica scowled and turned away, sulking.`
`"......His condition can't be that bad, can it, with that kinda temper?`
` I mean, if they were saying he's not feeling well that'd be one thing, but if it's his mood that's bad, at least it's proof he's got some fight in him."`
`"Well, Grandfather does have especially strong willpower.`
` ...But, it doesn't mean that his body will always follow that.`
` Since last year, they keep saying that he has three months left."`
`"...If the initial diagnosis was correct, Grandfather has been prolonging his life by willpower alone.`
` ......We have to be concerned for him."`
`Lunch started with the family head's seat still empty.`
`...The man who should have been sitting there was already old,`
` and the brilliant glory which had rebuilt the Ushiromiya family in a single lifetime was slowly being forgotten.`
`Nobody seemed to feel uncomfortable when the meal began with that seat still empty...`
