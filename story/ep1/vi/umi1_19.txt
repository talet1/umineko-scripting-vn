`"...What sort of tea should I prepare next?`
` You have free choice of any brand that ever was throughout the ages."`
`"......Dried plum tea.`
` ......Those dried plums that go for 200 yen a pack."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` ...For a thousand years I have been fond of black tea, but I did not know of such a thing.`
` ...I will never tire of living in this world."`
`"...............Beato.`
` You don't have to display such hostility.`
` ...I am just a wandering witch.`
` I didn't come with the intention of violating the rules of your territory."`
`"...*cackle*cackle*, there is not even a sliver of hostility.`
` ...I am just terribly concerned about seeing that the legendary witch, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}, is well attended to."`
`".........You misunderstand.`
` I am powerless.`
` Before a witch such as you, with the dreadful power to kill a person a hundred times over, I am completely powerless."`
`"That a "powerless" witch like you possesses a power that none can approach is what is truly terrifying.`
` After all, you fended off that Great Witch, Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta}, as a lone piece."`
`"......I only won an endurance contest.`
` She simply got tired."`
`"That is not what Lady {f:5:Lambdadelta} said, though.`
` ...*cackle*cackle*cackle*, too much humility can be unseemly, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}."`
`"......That girl has a dreadful power.`
` ............The power to kill a person "without fail".`
` However, there is no such thing as "without fail" in this world.`
` Just as, no matter how many times you divide 1, you can never make it 0."`
`"That girl has the power to bring that closer and closer to "virtually zero", and give rise to a "virtually absolute certainty".`
` ......I hope I never have to fight such a terrifying witch again."`
`"However, you have a power that manifests without fail "except for zero".`
` ......Although you say there is no such thing as "without fail" in this world, you possess an infallible power yourself.`
` ......How very terrifying, *cackle*cackle*cackle*...!"`
`"......The power to kill a person "endlessly"...`
` ...I think you're the more terrifying one."`
`"Such jests.`
` ......From your point of view, mine is but a trifling power.`
` The phrase "flattery will get you nowhere" was made for this situation."`
`"......Call it payment for my stay here.`
` ...I am a fleeing traveler who crosses the {ruby:kakera:fragments}, continually running from boredom.`
` ......I simply came around because I'd heard that you'd started something interesting.`
` Rest assured, I will leave of my own accord as soon as you start to bore me."`
`"*cackle*cackle*...!`
` I am deeply and humbly delighted to have the great Lady {f:5:Bernkastel} as an observer.`
` *cackle*cackle*!`
` And so, your impression?"`
`"............{f:5:Lambdadelta} is terrifying because of her cruelty; however, she was a girl I could understand.`
` ...You do seem to possess affection, but I can't understand you at all.`
` That's why you're much more terrifying than her."`
`"*cackle*cackle*cackle*...!`
` I am fickle by nature.`
` Do forgive me.`
` ...Besides, I believe you also enjoy trusting your fate to the roll of fickle dice—is that not so, Lady {f:5:Bernkastel}?"`
`"......When I roll the dice, I have a roll I clearly want to get.`
` Unlike you.`
` You, on the other hand, anticipate all outcomes."`
`"And, whatever the roll might be, you're never disappointed.`
` Whatever roll the dice show you, you are satisfied "without fail".`
` .........In that sense, you far surpass me."`
`".........You're one I really don't want to fight with.`
` Inside of you, there's nothing but zero.`
` That's why I can't win against you with my power.`
` ...The worst matchup.`
` ......Perhaps {f:5:Lambdadelta}, on the other hand, has a good matchup against you.`
` Since she would likely be able to kill your "endlessness"."`
`"*cackle*cackle*, *cackle*cackle*cackle*!`
` ......Truly, tea is best drunk in the company of a witch.`
` It's never boring.`
` *cackle*cackle*!"`
`"......Good to hear.`
` Boredom is the sole poison that can kill me.`
` ......So, don't kill me, alright?`
` Lady {f:5:Beatrice}, Endless Witch."`
`"If such is your wish, I shall show you an even better time."`
`"......In that case, wouldn't it be best if I brought the next chessboard in right away?`
` It seems that the next tale would do more for you than a refill of tea."`
`"................................."`
`"Just wait for a moment.`
` ......*cackle*cackle*!"`
`............Something troublesome seems to have taken a liking to you.`
`I'd really like to lend you my power, but as you just heard, that girl's power and mine have a very bad matchup.`
` Unfortunately for you.`
`But you really are pitiful, so I'll help you out just a bit.`
`First of all, about that girl.`
`She does have an existence that goes by the name of {f:5:Beatrice}, but that doesn't necessarily mean that she is "a woman with an individual body".`
`Do you understand what I mean?`
` In other words, she's not some {y:0:Human}{n:0:human}.`
` Her existence is a personification of the rules of this world.`
`To beat her, you have to expose the rules of this world and unravel them.`
`This can be likened to learning the rules of chess by watching a few games.`
`First, take a good look over the chessboard.`
`And notice the movements and roles of the pieces.`
`Then, look for the conditions required to win at her game.`
`When you've managed to reveal all of these things, her heart will be exposed.`
`After that, you can rip it apart or crush it as you please.`
`......I am being quite generous.`
` Back when I was once human, it took me a hundred years to realize even this much.`
`This is my meager farewell gift to you, the pitiful one captured by Beato. It is like a single spoon.`
`A spoon can be used for more than just drinking soup.`
`You can use it to dig through the prison you're locked in, or as a weapon to gouge the witch's eyes out.`
`......Of course, you can also use the spoon to continually sip the watery soup inside your eternal prison.`
`......Don't get the wrong idea—I have no intention of becoming your ally.`
`I do feel empathy for you, but I won't help you.`
`...It's like how someone sitting in front of a television cannot reach the characters on screen no matter how much they yell at them.`
`{a:c:`
`THAT'S HOW YOU CAN TELL I AM A WITCH, YOU SEE?}`
`I intend to enjoy the endless tales that Beato is going to weave until I tire of them.`
` But I'm sure that alone won't hold my interest.`
`......That's why I'll lend you my power.`
` It's all so that I don't get tired of this.`
`I am the cruelest witch in the world.`
`No matter who the opponent may be, I'll absolutely make them surrender.`
`...Even if that's {f:5:Beatrice}, the Endless Witch...`
`You are my game piece.`
` Give it your best shot.`
`I'll give you advice sometimes, out of her sight.`
`Don't bore me, okay......?`
`*giggle*giggle*giggle*......`
