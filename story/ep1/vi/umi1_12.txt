`Lunch had ended, and the servants had removed the tableware, and were now in the kitchen.`
`{n}The wind and rain had neither weakened nor strengthened, and the island remained cut off from the outside world.`
`It seemed that, at first, Natsuhi had planned not to let anyone set one foot outside the room,`
` but when it came time to prepare lunch, she finally realized that this was impossible.`
`However, in order to avoid having anyone alone in the kitchen, she told the three servants to go together.`
`Because of that, the servants were the first ones given the right to leave the stuffy parlor, which had been packed with eleven people.`
`......Since breakfast had immediately followed that terrible incident,`
` and many of them hadn't eaten much, everyone tore into their lunches in silence.`
`"I will wash the dishes, so you can rest a while, Genji‐san, Kanon‐kun.`
` ...Do you want something to drink?"`
`".........Nothing for me.`
` .........Kanon?"`
`"......Nothing for me either."`
`"You two must have been so busy, and so early in the morning...`
` It's no wonder you're worn out..."`
`The only sound was that of Kumasawa washing the dishes, which resounded throughout the kitchen.`
`Genji and Kanon sat in some chairs a short distance away, their eyes lightly closed.`
`Just as Kumasawa had said, those two had probably built up a great deal of fatigue.`
`But that didn't mean they could let it show in front of the relatives.`
`...Avoiding that was one of their virtues.`
`After the silence had continued for some time,`
` .........Kanon opened his mouth and muttered.`
`"...............Shannon...`
` ...............Why...did she have to die in such a horrible way...?"`
`"......Forget about how she died.`
` .........It was nothing more than...bad luck."`
`".........You're right.`
` ...It was nothing more than bad luck..."`
`They both fell silent once again.`
` ...Kanon's expression was filled with grief.`
`"To think that Shannon‐chan's actually dead...`
` I still can't believe it.`
` ......Poor, poor Shannon‐chan...`
` ......Not being able to meet her again feels like a lie...`
` I just wanted to see that girl's smiling face one more time..."`
`Kumasawa spoke with her back facing them.`
`...Kumasawa hadn't seen Shannon's corpse,`
` so she had no trouble mentioning Shannon's face.`
`...When Kanon heard those words, it reminded him again of how only half of Shannon's face had been left, and his grieving expression twisted even further...`
`".........Why did {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama do that to Shannon...?`
` ......If she wanted a sacrifice, there were plenty of others to choose from...`
` ......Why... ......Why...?!"`
`".........It was nothing more than bad luck.`
` ...If chance had fallen even slightly differently, it could have been me or you lying out there."`
`"Or even someone else.`
` ......Everything is left to fate."`
`"Genji‐sama.`
` .........You said that the door to Madam's room was stained with traces of something like blood, right...?`
` The same substance that was painted on the shutter?"`
`"......Yes.`
` ...It was an unpleasant mark.`
` Almost as though someone with blood‐stained fingers had been trying to pull out the doorknob,`
` ...no, scratch through the door...`
` ...That sort of unpleasant mark."`
`"So does this mean that...{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama came to visit Madam's room,`
` ......and tried to open the door, but...`
`couldn't...?`
` Is that what this means...?"`
`Genji thought back to the time he had seen those traces of blood on the door to Natsuhi's room...`
`With the substance sticking to the door around the doorknob, and the marks of something scratching against the door...`
`it had definitely appeared as though someone had tried to open the door,`
` but couldn't...`
`"...Why...`
`......was Madam not chosen as a sacrifice...?`
` If only she had been chosen,`
` ......Shannon wouldn't,`
` ......Shannon wouldn't have had to die..."`
`Just then, a loud, sharp noise resounded from the hall.`
`{n}Both of them turned around, surprised.`
`"........................Sounds like a pretty interesting discussion you're having.`
` Let me join in too."`
`Battler was standing in the doorway to the kitchen.`
`"......Battler‐sama.`
` Please, excuse me..."`
`Genji‐san and Kanon‐kun stood up, surprised, and hastily bowed.`
`...But I didn't care about stuff like that.`
`{n}I was more concerned with continuing their discussion.`
`"I told them I was going to the bathroom, so they let me go.`
` I thought I'd suffocate if I was locked up in that room any longer."`
`"...When I was about to come ask you for some water, I overheard something pretty interesting.`
` ......You don't need to bow your heads or anything.`
` Please, let me hear the rest."`
`"............That just now......wasn't really......"`
`"I've been listening to you for a while.`
` Don't try to hide it now."`
`"............So I'll ask directly.`
` ...Who is this {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` She's supposed to be a witch from a kid's story, but it doesn't look that way now."`
`"........................"`
`Kanon‐kun averted his gaze.`
`...It was obvious that he didn't want to talk about this,`
` ...which only made me want to ask even more.`
`While making an effort to smile, I grabbed the collar of his shirt.`
`"......If it were last night, this'd be none of my business.`
` But after this morning, everything's changed.`
` Now that Dad and the rest have been killed, this is totally my business.`
` .........I have the right to listen to this suspicious story, don't I...?"`
`I glared into Kanon‐kun's eyes as he still continued to look away, in apparent pain.`
`...Since there was a big difference in our heights, Kanon‐kun had to stand on his toes, and it looked like it hurt a bit.`
`"............Battler‐san...`
` ...Please let go of him...`
` It's not like Kanon‐san is really hiding anything..."`
`"Then you won't have any problem talking about it, right?`
` It's lonely being out of the loop, get it?"`
`When I tried to further twist up his collar, Genji‐san cut between us and spoke.`
`...There was a slight sense of resignation on his face.`
`{n}......It looked like he didn't plan on hiding anything.`
`".........I can talk about it.`
` ......Kanon only hesitated because you might have taken it badly, Battler‐sama..."`
`"Hesitating isn't very manly, is it?`
` Keeping it a secret's even more unpleasant."`
`"......Tell me about it.`
` It's not like I have anything better to do before tomorrow comes.`
` A slightly shady story might be the best way to stave off boredom."`
`After Genji‐san and Kanon‐kun looked at each other, they nodded as though they had decided to talk...`
`"......Understood.`
` Please ask us anything.`
` ............We will talk."`
`"Right.`
` Then I'll ask."`
`"......Who in the world is {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` ...All I know is that she's a witch who lives in the forest of Rokkenjima.`
` ...I've heard that it's a story that Grandmother or someone invented to keep people out of the dangerous forest.`
` ......Is that wrong?"`
`"............No, ...it isn't wrong.`
` It's as you say.`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is a witch who dwells in the forest of Rokkenjima."`
`"......Battler‐sama.`
` .........I don't expect you to believe this all of a sudden, but...`
`{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama exists.`
` ...She is a real person, the one who gave the Master a vast amount of gold and who has worked by his side for many years."`
`"Huh...?`
` Ah, come on...`
` Is Grandfather paying you to repeat everything he says...?"`
`I laughed like it was a joke,`
` but neither Genji‐san nor Kanon‐kun laughed,`
` ......not even Kumasawa baa‐chan, who avoided my eyes, flustered, and started washing the utensils.`
`So unfortunately, I was the only one laughing.`
` ...Painfully, bitterly.`
`"......I see now why you warned me, Genji‐san.`
` ...Anyone sane would take this badly.`
` ............So you're saying that a person named {f:5:Beatrice} actually exists?"`
`"......Yes.`
` She has been working for the Master since before the mansion was built on this island.`
` ...Most likely, she has been working for him even longer than I have."`
`"What do you know, Kyrie‐san's theory was off...`
` ......Grandfather really did have a confidante called {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ......And she's on the island now...?"`
`"...............Yes.`
` I believe that she is here."`
`"...That's a vague way to say it.`
` I guess that means you haven't seen her face today or yesterday."`
`"......Yes.`
` ......It is extremely difficult to say, but...`
`...umm..."`
`Kanon‐kun once again dropped his gaze, avoiding my eyes.`
`"...Come on, don't just stop there.`
` That's like freezing an inch before the blow!"`
`I urged him on jokingly.`
`...However, it looked like Kanon‐kun was still unsure as to whether he should speak or not.`
`.........Then, Kumasawa baa‐chan whispered.`
`"...Hoh‐hoh‐ho...`
` You cannot see her face,`
` .........because {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has no form..."`
`"............She has no...`
`......what?"`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has no body.`
` ...Therefore, unless {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama wishes it, common people like us are not able to see her form."`
`"I have heard that the portrait shows what {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama looked like back when she had a human form...`
` ......I hear she often lingers in front of the portrait, yearning for her old form...`
` ...Hoh‐hoh‐ho..."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama sometimes changes her form into glittering butterflies and shows herself.`
` ......On the rare occasion that you spot them somewhere in the mansion, there is a rule that you absolutely mustn't chase after them."`
`"It is whispered that you will meet with disaster if you follow them.`
` ...In fact, there was a servant who broke that rule and quit because of a great injury."`
`"......Wait a sec, are you kidding me?`
` Are you all serious about this......?"`
`"...Battler‐sama, {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has already arrived.`
` Such language may be unwise."`
`"{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is not fond of those who profane her.`
` ......If you doubt her existence, you will surely meet with disaster."`
`"Battler‐san... You probably find this story unpleasant.`
` But you know what?`
` {f:5:Beatrice} does "exist", okay?"`
`"......She "exists".`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has an exceptional dislike of that being called into question."`
`"............Don't you understand, Battler‐sama?`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice}‐sama has already arrived here..."`
`"...Come on, quit it.`
` I'm weak against that stuff, you know...?`
` You're freaking me out..."`
`However, there was no trace of a joke in the eyes of the three servants.`
`On the surface, I laughed and tried to look unconcerned, but I was quickly starting to sober up.`
`{n}...Their eyes were also sobering up fast.`
`"......Battler‐san... I beg that you stop profaning {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Please trust me..."`
`Kumasawa baa‐chan, who was usually cheerful and would always tease people,`
` ......now spoke with a totally straight face that I had never known her to make.`
`".........W‐......well...`
` Sure you say she exists...`
` But I don't see anything...`
` Are you trying to say that she's standing right next to me or something?`
` Quit joking around..."`
`"Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi......"`
`Just then, that unnerving laugh suddenly filled the kitchen...`
`...When I turned around, Maria was standing there by the entrance.`
`{n}...But her expression and the feeling about her, her presence...felt exactly the same as the servants.`
`"...Whether your wavelength matches or not is determined at birth.`
` Battler, you were born with a mismatched wavelength.`
` That's why you can't see her,`
` can't meet with her,`
` can't talk to her."`
`"...Kihihihihihihihihihihihihihihihi.`
` You're the type {f:5:Beatrice} hates the most."`
`Maria's laugh sounded like she was greatly enjoying herself, ...yet it was extremely eerie.`
`......It was almost like she was laughing at me because I alone didn't understand.`
`"Do you want to know about {f:5:Beatrice}?`
` ............{f:5:Beatrice} is a thousand‐year‐old witch.`
` ......She has all the demons at her command, and can harness the power of alchemy to create the philosopher's stone and a vast quantity of gold.`
` Grandfather built up all of the vast wealth of the Ushiromiya family by making a contract with her."`
`"......Yesterday, I read {f:5:Beatrice}'s letter, didn't I?`
` That was real.`
` ...Well, I guess it's pointless for me to try and force you to believe."`
`"...After all, it looks like you were born without a trace of the sixth sense.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...!"`
`"......What are you talking about?`
` Witches, demons?`
` Who told you that...?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihihi.`
` I heard it from {f:5:Beatrice} herself.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!"`
`Maria kept doing that unpleasant laugh.`
`{n}...However, the servants who watched over this didn't even blink.`
`She heard it from...that witch in the portrait adorning the entrance hall.`
`{n}Maria kept on laughing in a weird voice, as though this was nothing more or less than the truth...`
`"...Maria, it might be rude to ask, but I'll ask one more time, okay...?`
` Who gave you that letter yesterday?"`
`"I got it from {f:5:Beatrice}. How many times must I tell you before you understand?"`
`"......You don't get it, do you?`
` You can't see her, I know.`
` You can't believe it, I know!`
` ...Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi."`
`Just then, Maria's laughter suddenly stopped.`
`".........Battler.`
` You still can't tell?`
` That {f:5:Beatrice} "exists"."`
`"She "exists", you say.........but where?"`
`"Like I said, {f:5:Beatrice} "exists", right here."`
`......That's right.`
`{n}Now that I think about it, I've been feeling for some time now that the others haven't been looking in quite the right direction.`
`...I'd figured that everyone had just been gazing into the distance, but......that wasn't the case.`
`The four here—Genji‐san,`
` Kanon‐kun,`
` Kumasawa‐san,`
` ...and Maria—`
` ......everyone except me—`
` ...............was looking at a spot right behind me......`
`Holding my breath tightly, I slowly looked over my shoulder.`
`...Of course, there wasn't anyone there.`
`{n}I've known that the whole time!`
`.........However, everyone in the room except me was focusing on that point as if there was someone there.`
`"{f:5:Beatrice} is a great witch of gold who has lived for one thousand years.`
` ......But she can't show her form to humans of the wrong wavelength, and she can't talk to them."`
`"...And you know what?`
` She finds that really sad.`
` ...That's why she truly despises it when people like you, who were born without a fragment of magic sensitivity, deny that she exists...!"`
`".........You're lucky, Battler.`
` Good thing that I gave you that charm yesterday, right?`
` Who knows what kind of curse {f:5:Beatrice} would have put on you by now if you hadn't been carrying it around.`
` ...You really are lucky, Battler.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi...!"`
`".........Right, that scorpion keyholder.`
` I'd thought that was just some cheap gift or something, but I guess it really had some benefit, then?"`
`"Kihihihihihihihi.`
` If it weren't for that, you'd be lying in that storehouse as a sacrifice with your face crushed by now.`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi, you're so lucky, Battler...!`
` Kihhihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!"`
`"......I see.`
` So if it weren't for that, I'd have been killed by now......"`
`"Battler, why don't you believe in {f:5:Beatrice}...?`
` Even though she "exists".`
` Right now, over there, look."`
`"Kihihihihihihihi!`
` Hey, I'll bet you want to believe it now.`
` Believe it.`
` And thank me for giving you that charm...!"`
`"If it weren't for that, you'd be in the storehouse right now.`
` But then, maybe you would have saved someone else in exchange, right?`
` Kihhi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi!"`
`Pff...!`
`......Right then, I burst into laughter.`
`{n}Playing witches had been pretty fun up until a second ago, but unfortunately, that last one didn't quite hit the mark.`
`"Hahahahahahah.`
` ......Then it's no goddamn good at all, is it, Maria?`
` If that's true, then I'm sorry, but it's no goddamn good at all."`
`When Maria saw me suddenly start laughing, she stopped.`
`{n}Even though she didn't understand what I was laughing at, she realized it wouldn't be pleasant for her.`
`".............................."`
`"I thought it might hurt you, so I didn't say it earlier, but..."`
`"......Although I thought I'd put that charm you gave me in my pocket,`
` I must have dropped it somewhere, you see?"`
`"......That means the charm can't be the reason I'm alive now, and even though I should have been cursed by the witch, I'm perfectly fine.`
` ......Sorry, but I don't believe in things I don't see with my own eyes."`
`"Sixth sense?`
` Wavelengths?`
` Magic sensitivity?`
` Sorry, but I don't believe in fake stuff like that.`
` When I hear the girls in class start talking about how good or bad their ability to sense the supernatural is, it pisses me off!"`
`"...I don't know how much Grandfather is paying you, but if you're trying to talk me into joining some cult,`
` believe me, you won't be able to do it that easily."`
`"...............Battler‐sama..."`
`"...You guys are free to believe whatever you want.`
` But when it comes to whether I believe or not,`
` that is always`
` for me`
` to decide!"`
`"Sorry, but I can't believe in something as shady as {f:5:Beatrice} until I've seen her with my own eyes...!!"`
`I spoke forcefully and sharply...`
`{n}When I did, Maria started cackling again.`
`"Kihhihihihihihihihihihihi...!`
` Well that's just fine, isn't it...?`
` Eventually, even people like you with totally mismatched wavelengths will be able to see {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`".........Very soon, she will revive.`
` {f:5:Beatrice} will revive.`
` ......Once that happens, she's promised to talk with me and play with me a lot."`
`"...There's neither a need to doubt nor to force yourself to believe.`
` ......She will appear, very soon.`
` Kihihihihihihihihihi...!"`
`Some people usually head to the bathroom after a meal; others prefer to take a short nap.`
`It seemed that several people had gone out of the parlor, just like I did when I went to the kitchen to drink some water.`
`In the end, Aunt Natsuhi's order to keep everyone packed together in the parlor was reluctantly withdrawn, under the conditions that:`
` no one was to be on their own,`
` and no one was to go far from the parlor.`
`After all, if eleven people are shut up in the same room starting early in the morning, the air will start to stagnate.`
`...And now that a little time had passed,`
` everyone had started to recover from the shock of that morning—maybe their sense of danger was weakening over time, too.`
`......However, it was a certain fact that six people had been killed inside this mansion,`
` so no one was completely negligent.`
`So when they went out into the hallway for a breath of fresh air, trying to act tough,`
` ......they would get scared of standing there, isolated, and would end up returning to the parlor.`
`...Like that fable.`
` You know, "The North Wind and the Sun".`
`{n}If you force someone to stay shut in, they'll resist, but if you tell them to do whatever they want, they'll come back, obediently.`
`People sure are hypocrites.`
`.........When the servants finished cleaning up from the meal,`
` they returned obediently to the parlor just as Aunt Natsuhi had told them to, and sat in a sofa near the entrance, patiently awaiting orders.`
`Maria, almost as though she had suddenly finished playing witches,`
` had returned to the pure Maria I knew well, saying "uu‐uu".`
`...What in the world was that back there?`
`{n}.........I hadn't felt even an atom of the presence of this person called {f:5:Beatrice}, supposedly standing behind me, invisible.`
`...However, it felt like, inside Maria, I could catch a glimpse of a little of that presence...`
`"You're right.`
` When Maria‐chan starts talking about witches, she changes.`
` ...Battler‐kun, you also saw it down by the beach yesterday, right?"`
`"You mean when she gave me that scorpion keyholder?`
` ...No, I don't mean like when her feelings were hurt,`
` I'm talking about when she looked like she had, you know, a dual personality."`
`"Aah, that happens sometimes too.`
` ......Just like when Maria started talking about the magic circle, not very often, but it happens.`
` It's freaky though."`
`Apparently, according to Jessica, the "Kihihihihihi" laughing Maria shows up every now and then.`
`This was just bad timing, and furthermore, it was the first time I'd seen it, so it really shocked me...`
`"So what is that?`
` Does Maria have a dual personality or something?`
` Or are you saying that her spiritual sense really is that strong, and she gets possessed by stuff like that?"`
`"...No, I don't think it's that.`
` Didn't you ever experience it?`
` A desire to be someone other than yourself, when you were small."`
`Right when humans are born, no one has any individuality.`
`{n}However, when they reach their growth period, and their sense of self starts to be born, they start to gain a sense of individuality.`
`They want to be different from other people.`
`...But of course, they will find that they're no different from the others in their class,`
` since they are learning the same thing in school and forced into the same lifestyle.`
`When they realize that, they start off by breaking the rules, in what's called the rebellious age.`
`{n}Since everyone follows the rules, they want to show off their individuality by breaking them.`
`...Even those who call everyone around them babies and stir up trouble...`
`are just cute kids searching for themselves when you look at them this way.`
`......Well, I'm lecturing about all this like I'm so smart, but I actually got it second‐hand from George‐aniki.`
`I myself was one of those embarrassing guys who thought it was cool to act like a little bastard...`
`Well, that was when I was the age where you try standing out for the opposite sex.`
`"At the very foundation of the growing period is an impulse to escape from being a kid, much the same as a chick trying to crack the shell of their egg.`
` Do you know what the difference between a child and an adult is?"`
`"Age?`
` Or physique?"`
`"No, it's experience.`
` Adults look down on children because children have very little life experience.`
` The reason they snort and look down on children whenever they say anything is because children don't know anything about the world."`
`"Yeah, I know what you mean.`
` When you're a kid, you try to say things like you've got life all figured out, and try to act like an adult.`
` ...No matter what a kid says, adults will just snort at them because they're too naive or because they'd "understand once they grew up" or something."`
`"...Well, it's probably true, but to a kid, it's just annoying, like they're being looked down upon."`
`"......I get it.`
` It's about whether they have knowledge and experience.`
` ...You're right, you don't earn respect just by becoming old and not achieving anything."`
`"Therefore, what we have is: a period where they have the impulse to escape from being a kid; and also, they want to have individuality, different from other people.`
` If what separates kids and adults is knowledge and experience, then...?"`
`"............I get it, if they know something that no one else knows, that's one way to form an identity."`
`"When you're in, like, elementary school, if you knew stuff no one else knew,`
` had stuff no one else had, wore stuff no one else wore, you could become a bit of a hero for it.`
` I bet you did the same thing, Battler."`
`"Yeah, yeah.`
` There was definitely an age when I wanted to excel in something.`
` ...I see, that was because I was trying to separate myself from being a child, my growing period."`
`"If you look at it in a good way, the growing period, by forcing you to separate yourself from others, pushes you to gain skills and knowledge that no one else has."`
`"...This is also interesting from a sociological standpoint.`
` Because people hate being like everyone else, they try to learn skills that other people don't know.`
` In this way, society can acquire the broad range of skills it needs to survive.`
` ...The quality of the gods' programming is truly surprising."`
`"Well, individual personalities can also be negative, right?`
` Like saying, everyone else in the class is studying hard, so I'll slack off so I stick out."`
`...That was actually me.`
`{n}It was only recently that I'd finally been able to feel thankful towards that middle school teacher who had slapped me after school.`
`"But, well, I did have those desires to jump over the vaulting box that no one else could,`
` or sprint as fast as I could trying to lap those guys with good grades when we did a marathon."`
`"...It was in my nature that, if I couldn't study well, then at least I could get back at them by exercising.`
` ......I get it, I really went all out during my growing period."`
`"I guess boys do tend to focus more on physical things."`
`"But you know? Girls of the same age tend to focus more on emotional things.`
` ......I'll bet there were groups of girls in your classes that were really interested in like, fortune telling and their spiritual senses."`
`"Yeah, yeah! There was, there was!`
` They'd come over, asking me for my sign and my blood type! And then they'd laugh, "Aah, I thought so, *giggle*giggle*!"`
` It really got on my nerves."`
`"No matter which class you go to, girls like fortune telling.`
` There was always a group that went on about spirit senses being strong or weak, or "sensitivity", or seeing things that can't be seen."`
`"That's because fortune telling and spiritual senses are things that aren't taught in school.`
` To girls, who unlike guys are more introverted,`
` that's a genre which is easy to build an identity upon, and one that they find very interesting."`
`"Just like when boys enter their growing period, and start acting tough and rebelling against adults,`
` when girls enter their growing period, they start getting interested in that kind of thing instead.`
` ......Well, not me though!"`
`"......So Maria having so much interest in the occult isn't that rare among girls her age?"`
`...Even if you accept that, ...I wonder if it explains that creepy dual personality thing...`
`............Well, I think I can accept it vaguely.`
`"As I said before, becoming an adult means gaining knowledge and experience.`
` So kids must study various things so that they can gain knowledge and truly awaken."`
`"...There is a specific kind of fantasy useful for this, which is and has always been prolific in the world of children.`
` Do you know what that is?"`
`"You see it all the time in manga and anime, right?`
` You know.`
` Like, memories coming back to you from a former life.`
` Or like, channeling the soul of the great whatever."`
`"Ah, there's also sleeping genes awakening,`
` or sealed powers or memories returning...there's a lot of versions.`
` For some reason, those kinds of things are really popular at that age.`
` ...Why's that?"`
`"All of those examples you've just mentioned are fantasies by which children can immediately add knowledge and experience to their childhood selves.`
` Even a nine‐year‐old girl simply has to say that she has a thousand‐year‐old witch possessing her,`
` and she can gain a 1009‐year‐old identity."`
`"So what you're saying is that for people who think studying is annoying,`
` but want to learn different skills from everyone else and brag about it, and get attention from it, it's a convenient delusion."`
`So you can brag about something without having to work hard or study.`
`{n}......I see, isn't that a kid's greatest dream?`
`"Furthermore, their ideal self image is always self‐projected onto their desires to escape from being a kid,`
` and it's not rare for that desired form to become established as an alternate personality."`
`"Even you, Battler‐kun, I'm sure your character is a little different at home and at school, right?`
` It would probably be embarrassing if anyone at school saw how you were at home.`
` At school, you try to project yourself as you want to be, but home is where you are your true self."`
`".........So, in other words, I'm changing my character for different situations.`
` ......Are you trying to say that having multiple personalities is actually really common?"`
`"A girl who is a fan of the occult might say that she's being possessed, or has awakened.`
` Honestly, there are some kids who can change their personalities so drastically, it can change your whole opinion of them."`
`"......Even some boys, right?`
` Guys who just blow their top and get violent over nothing.`
` I bet they think it's pretty cool, but it's painful to watch."`
`"So let's sum this all up.`
` ...Girls of about Maria's age, even if they show a creepy second personality like she did a minute ago,`
` you're saying that's not such a rare thing...?"`
`"If you bring it all together simply, that's what it means.`
` ...Identity is an important thing used to build up one's sense of self.`
` If you make fun of that, it could actually cause children to go back into their shell."`
`"So it's important to go along with them to some degree.`
` ...Although to accept it completely requires the tolerance of a parent."`
`"......Aniki, I can't believe you aren't married...`
` You sound like you've already raised kids through middle school.`
` .........Then, I wonder if Auntie Rosa also knew much about Maria's dual personality."`
`"She knew.`
` .........Just between us, Auntie Rosa couldn't friggin' stand it.`
` She said it was creepy, and it was just making Maria more and more separated from the rest of the class."`
`"So any time Maria started talking about the occult or laughing like a witch, she'd slap her.`
` ...And it looks like Maria stopped talking that way in front of her."`
`.........Maybe it was just a little game, from a girl facing her growing period,`
` ...that thing that had happened back there.`
`Just a girl trying to show that she was different and independent by holding interest in witches and the occult.`
`...And since she wanted to have another side to herself that wasn't infantile, she was switching between her normal personality and the personality of her ideal, a witch.`
`.........In the beginning, I had found that very disturbing,`
` but after George‐aniki's lecture, it felt like this was a path that everyone walked down at one time or another.`
`......I haven't told anyone, but when I was in kindergarten,`
` I joined up with a little gang of kids trying to form a Earth Defense Force, saying we'd help protect peace on earth.`
`My face turns red when I remember how, during what we called battle practice, we would chant "EDF! EDF!"...`
`Just like usual, Maria was relaxing,`
` immersed in the TV, "uu‐uu"ing and laughing just like any girl her age.`
`......But on the inside, another personality, that of the ideal witch that she admired and blindly accepted, was sleeping.`
`But that wasn't anything extraordinary; it was perfectly natural for a girl of her age...`
`............I calmed down a little.`
`{n}I had started to recover from the shock of my bizarre experience in the kitchen.`
`...If I hadn't talked to Aniki and Jessica, I might still have been frightened by the idea that an invisible witch was standing right behind me.`
`...However, ......can I really accept that as an explanation of what happened back there?`
`If it had just been Maria, I could have explained it as the fickle fantasies of a growing girl.`
`...But Genji‐san, Kanon‐kun, and Kumasawa baa‐chan had also been there.`
`None of them had denied what Maria said.`
`.........They had silently accepted that {f:5:Beatrice} "exists".`
`I was starting to feel a little uneasy...`
`Auntie Eva had claimed that no 19th person exists,`
` saying that someone within the family had committed the crime in connection with their messy quarrel.`
`On the other hand, Aunt Natsuhi had claimed that the culprit was hiding somewhere outside the mansion.`
`That meant that she was denying that the crime had been committed by one of us, and accepting that a 19th person exists.`
`And in the kitchen, Maria and the servants had agreed that a 19th person exists.`
`But according to them, this 19th person isn't human.`
`{n}......They had said that it was an invisible witch, plotting something mysterious.`
`Is there a 19th person, or not?`
`{n}And is the culprit a human, or a witch?`
`For some reason, I couldn't just laugh off any of the possibilities.`
`{n}...Not even the most ridiculous one about the witch.`
`"......Jessica,`
` all I know about the story of the witch is that it was a story made by the adults to keep the kids too scared to enter the forest, but...`
`...is it different here in the mansion...?"`
`"............Hmmm...`
` I'm with you on this."`
`"I think it was just a dumb ghost story made by the parents so their kids would listen to them.`
` ......But I can't deny that the atmosphere inside the mansion makes it a little hard to say it out loud..."`
`"......Because Grandfather has proclaimed that {f:5:Beatrice} does exist.`
` And because of their position, the servants can't doubt that.`
` Jessica's mother and father don't want to get into a fight with him either, so on the surface, they go along with it."`
`"......So you could probably say that, inside this mansion, doubting the existence of {f:5:Beatrice} is a kind of taboo.`
` Unlike the rest of us, who only come here once a year.`
` ......Is that right?"`
`Jessica puffed out air in admiration...`
`{n}It looked like Aniki had guessed right.`
`"......You've got it totally.`
` No one really believes it on the inside.`
` ...But on the outside, they accept she exists."`
`"See, it's just like the way some people are about gods.`
` Even if you know there's actually no such thing, it feels rude to actually say that out loud..."`
`"......How do you think the servants feel about it amongst themselves?`
` Is it true that, since Grandfather who employs them says she "exists", they have to go along with it...?"`
`"Well...`
` I don't really know the details,`
` ......but between the servants, the story about {f:5:Beatrice} has been treated a bit like a ghost story."`
`"...Remember yesterday, when Shannon was talking to us down by the beach?`
` About how they saw unsettling things while doing the rounds in the mansion at night."`
`She had said something like that, hadn't she...`
`Back then, I didn't give it much thought, assuming she was just going along with the displeased Maria,`
` ...but now that I think about it, she did say that, and completely seriously.`
`......That's right.`
` She definitely said it.`
`...She definitely said the same kind of thing that Genji‐san and the rest had all unanimously declared back in the kitchen...`
`"In addition, some servants have also seen will‐o'‐the‐wisps and glittering butterflies dancing around.`
` ......Kanon‐kun also said he saw something like that when he went patrolling one night."`
`"And recently, the servants have been talking about strange footsteps inside the mansion near midnight.`
` We have whispered together that the {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama from the portrait sometimes walks through the mansion invisible."`
`"...It happened a long time ago, but I have also heard those kinds of footsteps while patrolling at night."`
`......That's right.`
` She definitely said that.`
`{n}Exactly the same thing that I had been told just now.`
`"Ah, ...but, there's nothing to be afraid of, you know?`
` {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama is another ruler of this mansion separate from the Master.`
` So, she won't do anything bad, as long as you respect her and don't act oddly afraid."`
`"However, she's fearsome if you don't respect her, right?"`
`"...Yes.`
` I heard that someone who quit just before I began working, after falling down the stairs and receiving a large injury to their back,`
` had been speaking badly of {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama.`
` Because of that, there was a rumor between the servants that {f:5:Beatrice}‐sama's anger had been brought down upon this person..."`
`"......If you don't respect her, her anger will be brought down upon you, and you will be injured.`
` ...So, to the servants, {f:5:Beatrice}'s existence...`
`is just as credible as the story that, if you pull pranks on {c:86EF9C:Inari‐san}, you will be cursed by the {c:86EF9C:kitsune}."`
`Of course, even though everyone accepts that curses and the like don't exist in the modern era,`
` ...people are still afraid and still have a little respect for them.`
`You see it a lot even in residential areas, such as when someone is building a house, and they call a Shinto priest for a ceremony to honor the god of that plot of land.`
`...You might think that's just a big waste of time and money,`
` but the workers say that a big accident will occur if they don't do it, so they apparently never neglect the procedure.`
`You also hear about how, if an Inari shrine is carelessly removed during a town replanning,`
` there would be a curse by Kitsune‐sama.`
`I think I might have read somewhere that when the occupying forces were trying to expand an airport, and had to remove an Inari‐san that was in the way,`
` all of the workers were suddenly taken out by some mysterious fever.`
`Even in modern cities like Tokyo,`
` it isn't rare to see modern buildings packed all around an old Inari shrine, leaving the shrine itself untouched.`
`And this isn't limited to Japan.`
`{n}It's probably similar to how people baptize babies.`
`If I remember correctly, by the Christian doctrine,`
` unbaptized souls, though their sin is the lightest, still fulfill the conditions for going to hell.`
`Putting water on a child's forehead doesn't do anything but make them cry.`
`But if a parent can prevent their child from going to hell with just that little effort, they will happily go through with that ceremony.`
`......In short, even in this modern society of reason,`
` we are still unable to throw away every trace of belief and fear.`
`...You could say that it's a passive acceptance of the supernatural.`
`Maybe the only difference on this island was that {f:5:Beatrice} was the name that was respected here...`
`"...So, in other words,`
` if anything happens that doesn't seem explainable in human terms, it's called the work of {f:5:Beatrice}."`
`".........I think Shannon‐chan was talking about it.`
` About windows and doors that had definitely been properly shut or locked being open the next time they were checked.`
` Lights that had been off being on, and lights that had been on being off."`
`"......And, if I remember right, Jessica, you used to joke that it was {f:5:Beatrice}'s doing that you couldn't find your bag sometimes when you went to leave in the morning, right?"`
`"Good memory.`
` ...Normally, you'd say a fairy took them, but on this island, it's {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` Man, what a stupid story."`
`"This mansion has been standing for about thirty years by now, hasn't it?`
` It's natural for things that old to get their fair share of ghost and occult stories.`
` Like the seven mysteries at a school."`
`"...............So here...`
`is where we "flip over the chessboard"."`
`"Huh?"`
`".........Basically, on this island, there's a rule that {f:5:Beatrice} can be blamed for anything that couldn't have been done by humans.`
` Anything that the humans can't do.`
` ......How many humans are there?`
` There's 18."`
`"............In other words, the culprit is modelling things after this rule, trying to make it appear that this crime was the work of the witch.`
` In short, they desperately want to claim this as the doing of a 19th person."`
`"............{i:I don't like it}.`
` I really don't like it."`
`"What don't you like...?"`
`"............Just assume that an invisible 19th person existed, and that this person wanted to make it known that they existed.`
` ......If it were me, I'd do it with more perfect timing."`
`"......What do you mean by perfect timing?"`
`"...Well.`
` After all, the crime took place after midnight while it was still dark, right?`
` People were talking together until midnight, some people had the night shift, and some people had returned to their rooms and were sleeping."`
`"...Everyone's alibi is really vague, and there's plenty of room to suspect that the crime was committed by one of us.`
` George‐aniki, Auntie Eva probably told you too, right?`
` That there's a good chance that one of us is the culprit?"`
`"...mh......yes.`
` ...I guess."`
`"......In other words, if the 19th person really existed and wanted to show themselves, this first crime was a complete failure."`
`"...No, in the first place, the timing was a mistake.`
` If this invisible 19th person really wanted to show themselves,`
` they had to make sure that the crime took place {i:under conditions which proved that the remaining twelve people were all innocent}."`
`"Unless there are no suspicious humans, they can't prove that they exist.`
` So by killing them in the middle of the night, when everyone's alibi was at its most ambiguous,`
` whether or not this 19th person exists was also at its most ambiguous.`
` Even so, they chose that time to commit the crime."`
`"......By committing the crime then, it's obvious that one of the 18 would be suspected.`
` ...Yet they took the name of the witch and handed Maria the letter, and everyone denies doing it."`
`"In other words, ......you're trying to say that one of the 18 is trying to make it look like a 19th person called {f:5:Beatrice} exists...?"`
`"That's pretty crazy......`
` ...I think my mom's theory that someone is hiding outside the mansion is a little more credible...`
` ...Battler, don't tell me you actually suspect that someone in this room is the culprit...?"`
`"Yeah.`
` ...Someone trying to force us to accept that {f:5:Beatrice} exists.`
` ......That's right, the letter last night is when this whole thing started.`
` ...I don't have any basis or proof, but..."`
`"......With the chessboard upside‐down, this is my best guess."`
`"......Seriously, that's too crazy...`
` Haven't you been reading too many weird detective novels...?"`
`"But it does hit on a point that we can't ignore.`
` ......Whether there's a 19th person or not,`
` the culprit is definitely planning something based around that rule about this island."`
`"......Just now, listening to Battler‐kun talk, I remembered something that's a little disturbing."`
`"Something disturbing...?"`
`"Yes.`
` ......Do you remember?`
` {f:5:Beatrice}'s letter.`
` ......It said that {f:5:Beatrice} was going to collect interest.`
` And as for what that interest is, it said: everything of the Ushiromiya family."`
`Jessica and I thought back on what Maria had read aloud the previous night...`
`"...It said that.`
` It definitely said that.`
` That the collecting of the interest would now take place, but if the riddle of the gold could be solved, she would lose that right."`
`"...Grandfather was granted the gold, and the Ushiromiya house prospered.`
` Basically, {f:5:Beatrice} is saying that everything he birthed from that gold counts as interest.`
` ......In other words—"`
`".........That's pretty scary for a joke, Aniki...`
` ......Don't tell me that everything of the Ushiromiya family—`
`in other words, everything that Grandfather gave birth to—`
`refers to everyone with Grandfather's blood flowing through their veins...?!"`
`"If you read the letter that way,`
` ...these murders are just {f:5:Beatrice} legitimately collecting interest.`
` ...If that's the case, these crimes will continue.`
` ...Because the collection of interest is still only halfway completed."`
`George turned around, looking over the parlor.`
`{n}......There were still many people who held the name Ushiromiya.`
`And we knew that, since Gohda‐san and Shannon‐chan had been killed,`
` not even the servants, who didn't bear the name Ushiromiya, would be spared...`
`"A‐...are we...`
`......all gonna be killed...?"`
`"...But that's weird, George nii‐san!`
` Why only six people, then?`
` They could have killed a lot more.`
` In the worst case, it might even have been possible for them to assault us all while we were sleeping and kill everyone in a single night.`
` Why didn't they do that?!"`
`"............The special clause.`
` ...If someone managed to solve the riddle of the gold, the right to the interest would be lost.`
` ......And remember how the very last part of the letter concluded?`
` ...It said for everyone to try to solve the riddle of Grandfather's gold."`
`"Jesus...!`
` ......It looks like we're finally getting close to understanding the culprit's message...`
` In other words, the culprit is telling us to try and solve the riddle on that epitaph Grandfather had made.`
` ......{i:Furthermore, they're saying that if we just sit around, they'll keep collecting the interest}..."`
`I realized that this was all based on several crazy guesses.`
`......But not everything that happens in this world is joined together in a perfect line.`
`...Most unknown phenomena are nothing but individual points.`
`{n}......By joining them together into lines, we deepen our understanding.`
`The closer together the points at the ends of those lines are, the more logical it is, and the easier to understand.`
`...And the farther away they are, the more it lacks those qualities.`
`{n}That is why we use a distance analogy, and call such theories "way out there".`
`{n}...However, if you can only join up to a small, limited distance away, we call it having a "limited imagination".`
`Is imagination different from reasoning?`
`{n}Was I just trying to force everything that I knew about the case to fit my simple imagination?`
`No, that's not it.`
`{n}When you're searching around with your hands in the dark, that search is imagination.`
`Only imagination can find the two points you should connect together.`
`{n}...Reasoning is nothing more than the action of drawing the line between them.`
`If you can't imagine, you can't reason.`
`{n}......What I was doing might be "out there"...but it shouldn't be wrong, either.`
`Only the power of imagination can pull out a clue from the darkness.`
`{n}......And the power of reasoning ties those clues together.`
`...It's a lot like the process of searching out an enemy's weak spot and striking.`
`It's alright if it's crazy.`
`{n}Find the weak point first.`
`{n}Then we can think about how to strike!`
`Now was the time to find the points that we could tie together later...!`
`For the time being, I put aside whether a 19th person exists,`
` and announced the theory that the goal of the culprit might have been to make us solve the riddle of the epitaph.`
`Uncle Hideyoshi looked like he was really interested, but Aunt Natsuhi thought it was ridiculous.`
`"Of course.`
` If you think about it that way, even that letter from yesterday makes sense.`
` That motive seems to fit pretty well with the facts...!`
` Settin' aside whoever it was that gave Maria‐chan the letter."`
`"Uu!`
` {f:5:Beatrice} exists!!`
` Uu."`
`Even though she was puffing up her cheeks in that cute way she had been doing since yesterday, ...I couldn't think of it as cute.`
`...If I took it lightly, it might suddenly transform into a creepy laugh...`
`"...The hidden gold doesn't exist.`
` However, the idea that we have a culprit who foolishly believes otherwise, wants Father's gold,`
` and whose motive is to make us solve the riddle and then steal the gold from us, does indeed make some sense."`
`"However, in that case, why did they kill those most highly ranked in the Ushiromiya family first?"`
`".........A good point.`
` If they wanted to make us solve the riddle, killing those closest to Kinzo‐san doesn't sound like a good plan to me."`
`"I agree...`
` Besides, if we follow that argument, wouldn't it have been quicker if they had threatened Father in the first place?`
` You'd think it would be faster to just ask the person who wrote it, rather than try to force us to solve it."`
`"That's also a good point.`
` ...'Course, I don't think that Father would let it slip from any ordinary threat."`
`"Anyone who knows Kinzo‐san well would surely be well aware that he won't bow to ordinary threats..."`
`"......He is the man who bears the burden of the Ushiromiya family and all its wealth.`
` He has been exposed to many threats and attacks in the past.`
` It is because he was able to overcome them that the family prospers today."`
`"Totally agreed on that.`
` I can't imagine our grandfather letting himself get pushed around just 'cause some asshole threatened him!"`
`"...Jessica, that is not how we talk."`
`"............u...`
`......yes."`
`"In that case, .........what about this one?`
` ......No wait, is this "out there" as well...?"`
`...I couldn't hesitate!`
` A crazy idea is like a bow and arrow.`
`...It might be hard to hit with, but it's a great weapon that can strike enemies from afar.`
`......Research shows that most people who have died in battles were killed by wounds from arrows.`
`......In a battle, you don't shoot off just one arrow.`
`You shoot off a whole bunch of arrows at once, and assault the enemy soldiers with a wall of them.`
`{n}......So shoot them, over and over!`
` "Assault the truth with a wall...!"`
`"If the culprit is after the hidden gold, it would be very inefficient for them to force us to solve the riddle.`
` Asking the person who made it in the first place would be much quicker and easier."`
`".........In that case, the question is,`
` ...is this all a message directed at Grandfather?"`
`In other words, these murders were a threat directed at Grandfather.`
`{n}......If he didn't tell the culprit where the gold was, his family members would be killed off one by one.`
`What if we weren't the only ones being forced to solve this riddle...`
` ...What if Grandfather was too?!`
`If you think about it that way, it explained Grandfather's mysterious disappearance.`
`If the culprit had attacked Grandfather, then judging by the state the six bodies were left in,`
` he would definitely have been displayed somewhere with that horrible makeup added.`
`But despite that, we still hadn't found him.`
` ......Did that mean that Grandfather had been kidnapped, and was being held somewhere?!`
`".........How could...`
` .........You aren't saying, how could......!"`
`"*giggle*giggle*.`
` That sounds interesting.`
` ...So Father is being confined somewhere,`
` and being threatened that if he doesn't tell them the location of the gold, we will be killed off one by one?"`
`"I struggle to understand what you find interesting about that...!"`
`Aunt Natsuhi threatened her, but Auntie Eva just smiled calmly.`
`"......Since we still haven't seen him after all this time, I think that it's almost certain that Grandfather has gotten caught up in the crime.`
` When you think about that, you can't just ignore Battler‐kun's theory, right...?"`
`"Stay quiet, George.`
` ......In the first place, when exactly was it that Father went missing?"`
`"...Who was the last one to see Father?"`
`".........It was probably me.`
` This morning, when we were worried that we didn't know where my husband and the rest were, we were talking about how they might be in Father's study,`
` and I went to check his room and greeted him."`
`".........Come to think of it, I've been holding the key to his study the whole time, haven't I.`
` Genji, let me return this to you."`
`Aunt Natsuhi pulled out the gold key and handed it to Genji‐san...`
`Looking at the key, Auntie Eva giggled...`
`"...Hey, Genji‐san.`
` I'm sure the police will inspect Father's room thoroughly anyway.`
` ...It doesn't matter what you hide, it will just be exposed anyway.`
` ......So you might as well just tell us about it right here, right now, don't you think?"`
`"............What are you talking about?"`
`"It's simple.`
` .........Don't forget, Father's study is a locked room, with no way in or out except for that key.`
` I want to double‐check how that's being defined.`
` There is one entrance to Father's study.`
` And also the windows?`
` Any other entrances or exits?"`
`"............There are none.`
` There is no way to get in except for the entrance."`
`"You're sure about that?`
` There isn't some secret hidden door or anything?`
` ......Since Father isn't here, I am the highest ranked member of the Ushiromiya family.`
` I am asking you as a representative of the Ushiromiya family head.`
` Understand that and answer me."`
`"Are there any ways in or out of that room other than the main entrance?`
` ......As Father's closest aide, I'm sure you know."`
`Aunt Natsuhi looked a little offended at the part about the "highest ranked family member",`
` but she kept her mouth closed for the time being, and waited for Genji's answer.`
`......I couldn't help but feel a little uncomfortable.`
`{n}Why was she going on and on about hidden doors...??`
`"You too, Kanon‐kun, Kumasawa‐san—if you know, won't you tell me?`
` If there is one, it would be better if you said it."`
`"...If there isn't, then someone is going to be very much driven into a corner in a second.`
` ......If I'm given that there is a hidden door, then my argument comes to nothing."`
`Auntie Eva didn't specify which person was about to be driven into a corner,`
` ...but following the flow of the conversation, I had to feel that she was referring to Aunt Natsuhi.`
`"......Mother, ...what are you talking about?"`
`"George, stay quiet for a while.`
` .........What do you say?`
` Genji‐san?`
` Kanon‐kun?`
` And Kumasawa‐san?`
` Is there a hidden door?`
` Or not?`
` Genji‐san, when you remodeled Father's study, you must have overseen the construction.`
` I won't let you say that you don't know."`
`"............There is nothing of that nature in the Master's study."`
`"You're sure?`
` What about Kanon‐kun, entrusted with the One‐winged Eagle?"`
`"......Yes.`
` I'm sure.`
` ......There is nothing like a hidden door in the Master's study."`
`"Kumasawa‐san?"`
`"N‐......no, I haven't heard of such a thing..."`
`"What about Doctor Nanjo, who had a close relationship with Father?"`
`"......I, I have never heard of something like that..."`
`"Great!`
` Then are you ready?`
` Let me begin.`
` It's really simple."`
`Everyone tilted their head doubtfully, wondering what Auntie Eva was so proudly starting to talk about.`
`...Auntie Eva laughed triumphantly, as though she were about to reveal a secret that only she knew.`
`"Natsuhi nee‐san was the last person to spot Father, right?`
` ...I forget the exact time, but I think it was a little before nine in the morning."`
`"......Nee‐san, do you remember?`
` I ran into you just as you were coming out of Father's study, right?"`
`"......Yes, I remember.`
` What does that have to do with anything?"`
`"And the next time you went to visit Father's study?`
` That was after we had found the bodies of Nii‐san and the rest, right?`
` Together with me, you went up to the study to report that, and we discovered that he wasn't there."`
`".........By the way, Nee‐san.`
` At that time, when you went to enter Father's study, did you notice anything?"`
`".........Notice anything?`
` ...What are you talking about?"`
`"Come on.`
` You picked up some trash, right?`
` A folded receipt."`
`"......I do seem to remember picking up some trash.`
` What does that have to do with...?"`
`"I got that receipt when I bought some candy at a store in the airport."`
`Auntie Eva pulled a small bag of candy out of her handbag.`
`"...Aah, the receipt from when you bought that candy?`
` ...But, Mother, what does that receipt have to do with anything...?"`
`"George, stay quiet and listen for just a little longer..."`
`Uncle Hideyoshi's expression was a little strict.`
`{n}...Somehow, it seemed that he understood what Auntie Eva was getting at.`
`"It was really just on a whim, you see?`
` It wasn't out of any foresight,`
` and I certainly wasn't planning on setting a trap for you or anything."`
`"......Actually, this receipt...`
` You remember, Nee‐san, that just after you met Father and left, you met me, right?`
` At that time, I stuck this into the door to the study."`
`"......So, what does that mean?`
` Does it mean that, until Aunt Natsuhi picked up that receipt, no one had opened the door...?"`
`"W‐wait a second, Auntie Eva...!`
` Sticking a receipt in would be obvious!`
` It's possible that, when Grandfather opened the door, he noticed it, found it interesting, and stuck it back in the door..."`
`Jessica hurriedly argued back.`
`...She still didn't really know what it meant,`
` but she realized that, whatever it was, it was placing some kind of suspicion on her own mother.`
`"Of course, I folded the receipt up very small so that no one would notice it.`
` But even if you assume that he saw it fall, he would have no way of knowing how high up the door it had been stuck, right?"`
`"I checked it while Natsuhi nee‐san was taking the key out.`
` The receipt was still stuck not one millimeter away from where I had put it...!"`
`"I, ......I can't understand why you would pull such a childish prank!`
` I, I'll bet you were the one who did that prank on the door to my room, too!"`
`"......The door to your room?"`
`"...It was unpleasant to talk about, so I didn't,`
` but this morning, when I woke up, there were the signs of some prank on the outside of my door, with what was probably the same red paint that was scribbled across the shutter.`
` There were some unpleasant marks, as though someone had been tearing at the door..."`
`"Wait, what is this!`
` Why have you been silent about this until now...?!!"`
`"My apologies.`
` Since so many horrid things have happened since then, I had completely forgotten about it until just now."`
`"I don't know or care about that.`
` I am not talking about your door, but the door to Father's room, okay?`
` After you checked that he was in his room, and until we made sure that he wasn't, that door wasn't opened even once.`
` How did Father get out if he didn't use the door?"`
`".........I, ...I don't know that...!`
` That's what I want to know!!!"`
`"Natsuhi nee‐san, other than you, who else checked to see whether Father was in his room?"`
`"The last time I met Kinzo‐san was when we were playing chess last night...`
` ...I believe I was with him until just before dinner......"`
`"Did anyone see him after that?"`
`"...............I did.`
` I gave him his dinner last night."`
`"......Yes.`
` Shannon and I were with him."`
`"So up till then, Father was still definitely in his room.`
` ...But, Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` It sounds like when you found out he wasn't there, all ways in or out of the study were closed, right?`
` ......But even so, you said that you met and talked with him this morning."`
`"......I, ......I don't understand why everyone has become so gloomy.`
` ...Could someone explain it to me...?"`
`"M‐......Mother and Father, are you...`
`......saying that what Aunt Natsuhi says about meeting Grandfather this morning...`
`...is a lie?"`
`"Wh‐why the hell would she tell a lie? Mom's innocent!!`
` Why the hell would she lie!!"`
`"Jessica!`
` I keep telling you to watch your language!"`
`All at once, everything became confused...`
`From across the parlor table, Auntie Eva and Aunt Natsuhi confronted each other,`
` while George‐aniki confronted Jessica...`
` ......What the hell is going on...?!!`
`"Remember, it's only up until last night that we have multiple people saying they saw him.`
` But the only one who claims that they saw Father since this morning is Natsuhi nee‐san."`
`"......And then there's that strange fact we learned from the receipt.`
` ...So, how can we connect these points together...?"`
`Auntie Eva urged everyone to work their imaginations...`
`......Sure, that receipt could become an important point.`
`{n}...But I didn't know what other point I could draw a line towards...!`
`The answer Auntie Eva was hoping for...`
`......was that Aunt Natsuhi had lied to make it seem as if Grandfather had been in that room this morning.`
`And Auntie Eva's mere whim had exposed that......??`
`"That makes no friggin' sense!!`
` Why the hell would Mom lie?!!`
` She has no friggin' reason to!!"`
`"......That's what I want to know."`
`"But Jessica‐chan.`
` You can't say that there's no possible reason for her to lie about Father being in the room, right?`
` You see it every once in a while in detective novels, don't you?`
` That trick of confusing the time of death to create an alibi."`
`"Wh‐what are you talking about?!`
` I've never even heard of that!!"`
`"...We still haven't found Father yet, but if you think about it normally, it would be natural to assume that he has already been killed.`
` In that case, we should expect to find his corpse soon."`
`"...If, at that point, the time of death could be faked, Natsuhi nee‐san would be able to create an alibi.`
` ......Do you understand?`
` Everyone?"`
`...This morning, when Aunt Natsuhi went to check that Grandfather was there, she lied,`
` ...and he was already dead at that time?`
`...And, she moved the body to some location, and disguised it to make it seem like he had just been killed there.`
`......And then she could stay with everyone else to prepare an alibi.`
`......And then, she could say "I heard someone screaming!"`
` or something and dash over there, and become the first to find the body along with everyone else... Is that what Auntie Eva's saying......?`
`"How preposterous.`
` Detective novels are nothing more than indulgent entertainment!`
` You can only think of such an indiscreet idea because you read them all the time!"`
`"Yeah!!`
` Even if she tried to fake the time of death a little, all of that would be blown away in an instant once the police did their autopsy!!`
` It might have fooled the people in old books, but do you seriously think that kind of trick would fly in modern Japan?!`
` Are you insane?!"`
`"......You think so?`
` This morning, when Doctor Nanjo looked at the corpses, he was only able to give a vague estimate of the time of death, right?`
` Autopsy results are affected greatly by the corpse's surroundings and individual peculiarities.`
` It's a very rough estimate with an uncertainty of several hours."`
`"And, unfortunately, the police's scientific investigation will have to wait until tomorrow.`
` Measuring the exact time of death after that, even in modern Japan like you said, wouldn't be that easy, you know?`
` Right, Doctor Nanjo...?"`
`"............Examining a corpse is an extremely difficult task that requires both experience and instinct...`
` I have heard that there is a very high rate of mistaken diagnoses...`
` I imagine it is very possible for a misreading of just a few hours to occur..."`
`"...However, for an alibi, that's more than enough!`
` It's not just a trick for the classics!`
` It's a trick that actually works!`
` ......Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` It's not like we want to suspect you, alright?`
` We don't, an' that's why we just want you to prove you're innocent."`
`"What is this innocence you want me to prove?!!`
` This morning, I definitely met with Father!!`
` And he told me to keep the One‐winged Eagle engraved in my heart...`
` ......Are you denying that he said that, too?!!"`
`"I will definitely not permit that!!`
` I won't permit you to deny that Father said those words!!"`
`"......Maybe Father's body won't appear at all?`
` Normally, a person has to be missing for seven years before they're officially declared dead.`
` Wouldn't that be a clever way to extend Father's nearly finished life another seven years and keep all of his wealth for yourself!"`
`"I, I cannot abide this!!`
` I cannot abide any more from you!!"`
`"I am Ushiromiya Natsuhi!!`
` Although I do not have the right to wear the One‐winged Eagle on my body, it is certainly engraved in my heart!!`
` Speaking that way to the wife of Krauss, successor to the head—to the person who will act as such in his place—absolutely disgusting!!!"`
`"What's thiiis?`
` Are you going to shoot me with that gun?`
` Go ahead, then?`
` Why don't you just shoot?!`
` You're just desperate because you can't think of a way out, aren't you?!`
` Do it, just try to obscure the truth with violence...!!"`
`"Y‐......youuu!!!!"`
`It wasn't like Aunt Natsuhi had been actually holding that gun at the ready and threatening anyone.`
`{n}But after she was told to by Auntie Eva, she did hold it at the ready!`
`...Unsurprisingly, once things got to this stage, Jessica and Genji‐san tried to stop her.`
`"...Madam, please, calm yourself......!"`
`"Mom, you aren't lying!`
` So there's no reason for you to listen to this!!"`
`"......Calm down, Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` Don't you just have to swear that Father was definitely in that room?`
` Why are you getting so worked up over that...?"`
`"...Th‐...that's right.`
` Natsuhi‐san isn't lying.`
` Isn't that the end of it...?"`
`"Then I want you to explain.`
` How did Father manage to disappear from the room?`
` ...The windows were closed tight from the inside.`
` And the door too, remember!"`
`"......If you really met with Father this morning,`
` ...then you must explain how he disappeared from this "unopened door" locked‐room scenario.`
` If you don't, that would mean that you are a liar after all, right?"`
`"How far do you plan to mock me......?!!!"`
`"If you want to argue back, go ahead!!`
` That's right, try explaining it right here, right now.`
` After that, I can apologize to you for doubting you.`
` How did Father manage to get out from that locked room?!!"`
`"I can't explain that, and I don't need to!!"`
`"Really?`
` Then let me explain it!`
` We'll take the best parts from my perspective and yours, and come up with a more friendly explanation!`
` ......I'll believe that, like you said, Father was still in his room this morning."`
`"But the next time the door was opened, Father wasn't there.`
` You don't have any objections so far, right?"`
`"I have no desire to listen to anything more you have to say!!`
` Shut your frivolous mouth!!"`
`"My reasoning goes like this, alright?`
` I verified on both occasions that you were the only one to go through that door.`
` And the receipt is proof of that!`
` So what is the answer to the puzzle of how Father was sent out of the room regardless?"`
`"The window!`
` He was sent out the window.`
` ......Natsuhi nee‐san, you pushed Father out of the third‐story window of the study into the courtyard!!!"`
`"YOU....VICIOUS MALCONTENT!!!!!!!!!!!!"`
`"Madam, please, endure it...!!"`
`"Eva‐sama... Please stop this.....!!"`
`"Father died from the fall into the courtyard,`
` and when you left saying you were going to check the doors and windows, you went and hid the corpse somewhere!`
` That was probably when you took some measures to fake the time of death, right?!"`
`"......This all ties in with the case regardin' Krauss nii‐san and the rest, and also the case regardin' {f:5:Beatrice} last night!`
` There's an extremely good chance that Natsuhi‐san is suspicious in those cases...`
` Normally, I wouldn't want to say this."`
`"...But now it's out in the open, there's nothin' else I can do...!`
` Please, Natsuhi nee‐san!`
` Please explain how you can be innocent!!`
` Or else, I can't help but suspect you...!!"`
`"Why me?!!`
` Why must I, Ushiromiya Natsuhi, be insulted like this!!!!!!!!"`
`...............Hmm.`
` ...Looks like everyone else has said their piece.`
`"Ihihihi.`
` ...No good. {i:No goddamn good at all},`
` Auntie Eva."`
`"...Wh‐...what do you mean "no good", Battler..."`
`Jessica looked up at me, hanging on to my every word.`
`{n}Auntie Eva's expression was composed as always.`
`"......No good at all, you say? What is?`
` Battler‐kun.`
` Tell me."`
`"You can only see this from one angle—that's why you're convinced that it has to be Aunt Natsuhi.`
` ...It's not like I'm defending her, but bluffing a checkmate like that isn't gonna work."`
`"I think the theory you've based around that receipt is passable.`
` It's not a bad thread of logic.`
` But I'd only give it a grade of 65 at best.`
` If this were an exam, that'd be bad enough to get you extra lessons in detention, you know?`
` Ihihi!"`
`"...Oh my. Well, how would you break through a door sealed by a receipt, and make Father disappear? Other than by my theory?!"`
`"Your theory is interesting, I admit.`
` And if we could state definitively that there was no way to make Grandfather disappear other than yours,`
` then we could say for certain that the last person to see him, Aunt Natsuhi, has to be responsible."`
`"However, since there still is a possibility that she is innocent, and that these accusations are false, you can't make that claim!!"`
`"......Hmm. Then, Battler‐kun, who are you saying could have made Grandfather disappear, other than Natsuhi nee‐san?`
` It would be impossible for anyone else to do it.`
` My receipt proved that, right?"`
`"From the first time she visited that study,`
` and until the second time when we visited it together, the study was a perfect locked room, and when the seal was broken on the locked room, he was already missing!`
` If this doesn't prove that she was the culprit, what kind of trick could they have used?!"`
`"Like I said, Auntie Eva, only 65 points.`
` So, let's try "flipping over the chessboard", shall we?`
` It's not about how they managed to make Grandfather disappear from the outside.`
` Think about how Grandfather disappeared from the inside."`
`"The door had the receipt stuck in it, so it couldn't have been used.`
` He also couldn't have gone through a window, because they can't be locked from the outside, and when you visited the study, you checked to make sure they were locked.`
` So the windows also weren't used.`
` At that point, the study really was a locked room.`
` We have to accept this!"`
`"However, the study didn't remain a locked room forever.`
` Once the seal created by the receipt was removed, it became possible to use the door, and possible to escape through the door."`
`"...In other words, it's not about how Aunt Natsuhi made Grandfather disappear.`
` ...We need to think about how he was able to escape!!"`
`"Grandfather's study isn't any ordinary study, right?`
` According to Genji‐san, there's a toilet and a kitchen and even a bedroom, almost like a little house.`
` ......If he hid under the bed, for example, he could trick the two of you into thinking he'd disappeared, right?"`
`"Auntie Eva, even you didn't check that carefully, did you?`
` And then the two of you went back down the stairs, thinking that he wasn't there."`
`"At that time, the receipt was already gone!`
` In other words, if Grandfather was hiding in his room the whole time when it was a locked room,`
` and escaped after letting the two of you go past him, we can crack this locked room right open!!"`
`"Wh‐what is this?!`
` Why would Father want to do something that weird and then escape the room?!`
` Don't be so absurd!"`
`"Yeah, it might be absurd.`
` However, it still shows that there is a possibility that Aunt Natsuhi is being accused falsely.`
` Your receipt wasn't perfect.`
` In chess, we might call that check,`
` but it isn't checkmate!!"`
`"And the thing that I like least,`
` is how you pressure Aunt Natsuhi to explain it, and then argue that if she doesn't, she must be guilty!`
` If that passes as logic, then why don't you let me......"`
`"...flip over the chessboard one more time!!"`
`"Auntie Eva, according to your argument,`
` ......you must explain to us here and now why you and Uncle Hideyoshi couldn't have killed those six last night and then casually returned to the guesthouse...!"`
`"You've been trying to force Aunt Natsuhi to explain.`
` I'm sure you can prove your own innocence, right?!`
` Auntie Eva, who's had all of Grandfather's wealth suddenly dropped right into her hands!!"`
`"Th‐that's right, you're pretty damn suspicious yourself, aren't you!!`
` If you say Mom's suspicious 'cause she was the last person to see him,`
` then what about you, Auntie Eva, who was the last person to see Dad and the rest?!!`
` Just like Battler said, prove that you two weren't the ones that killed them!!"`
`".........Mother, I also think that your reasoning was a little overeager.`
` ......I'm sure that the receipt was an important hint."`
`"But, like Battler‐kun said, that's not enough to prove that Aunt Natsuhi is guilty to any degree.`
` ......We're all equally suspicious.`
` It's not right for only Aunt Natsuhi to be persecuted."`
`"Our, our noble father, crawling on the floor under his bed?`
` You call nonsense like that an explanation?!"`
`"Then why don't you explain first?!!`
` Who killed those six, and how, and then try showing us proof that you weren't involved!!"`
`"......*cough*,`
` *cough* *cough* *cough*,`
` *cough*,`
` *kof*!!!`
` uu, *cough* *cough* *cough*!!`
` *coughCOUGH*!!`
` *kofkofkofkof*!!!"`
`"Milady... Milady...!!"`
`Jessica suddenly started coughing.`
` At first I thought that she was just choking after yelling too loud, but it seemed to be lasting too long for that, and she really looked like she was suffering...`
`Jessica kept coughing and choking, down on her hands and knees...`
`"Jessica... Hang in there...!!`
` Doctor Nanjo...!"`
`"...Jessica‐san, your inhaler, quickly.`
` ......No, wait, I have one with me."`
`Doctor Nanjo pulled a bronchodilator inhaler from his own bag, which was lying on the sofa, and handed it to Kanon‐kun.`
`......Come to think of it, six years ago, didn't Jessica sometimes break into violent coughing and have to use that...?`
`But six years ago, I never saw Jessica look like she was in this much pain.`
`"......Aniki, was Jessica's asthma always this bad...?"`
`"It's gotten a lot worse these last few years...`
` It's no problem when she's normal...`
` But when an attack comes suddenly, she can't stop coughing."`
`"*cough* *cough*!!`
` uu, ga*COUGH* *coughcough*!!`
` *kofkof*, *kofkof*!!"`
`"......Milady, your medicine.`
` .........Here..."`
`"...............nnn...`
`...`
` ......*coughcough*!!"`
`Taking the inhaler from Kanon‐kun, Jessica used it with a practiced hand.`
`...For a while, it looked like her throat was still feeling itchy, but it gradually settled down...`
`"Are you alright, Jessica...?`
` You scared me..."`
`"......It's no big deal.`
` ...Don't worry about it..."`
`Beads of sweat covered Jessica's whole body and she couldn't hide her rough breathing, but it looked like her sudden attack had calmed down for now...`
`This disturbance had left the room's hostile atmosphere in an awkward, unsettled state.`
`But that was fine.`
` ......There was absolutely no need to be driving up everyone's suspicions of each other.`
`When you think about it, even probing at each other's alibis and searching for the killer were probably completely unnecessary.`
`After all, we're just powerless, ordinary people,`
` and when the police come tomorrow, they'll definitely employ cutting‐edge techniques and investigate the case thoroughly,`
` solve all of the riddles and arrest the killer...`
`"............I wonder if Battler‐kun is right after all.`
` ...Just like Natsuhi nee‐san is suspicious, I can't ignore the fact that we are suspicious too.`
` Arguing about that now is certainly unproductive.`
` ...Everything will be fine if we just leave it to the police tomorrow."`
`".........But don't you want to know too, Battler‐kun?`
` Who the killer is?`
` ...Don't you want to let them know right this very second the pain you feel from losing someone precious to you?"`
`".........I won't deny that.`
` Even one day would be too long to let the bastard who pulled this detestable bullshit go."`
`"......But that doesn't mean that I want to doubt one of the 18.`
` Even though I said what I said earlier, I don't even want to doubt you, Auntie Eva.`
` ...To me, you're an awesome aunt who's always mischievous and entertaining."`
`"......I don't want to trade insults with an aunt like that.`
` Not a single person here wants to do that.`
` .........Right?`
` Everyone?"`
`"..................I feel the same as Battler‐kun.`
` ...It's pointless to trade insults.`
` ......It's probably just the stress built up because so many people have been crammed in one place since morning."`
`"......Probably.`
` It is only natural...`
` It may be easier said than done, but I think we should all relax as much as possible..."`
`"...............Eva.`
` Don't you think we should cool our heads?`
` ...I do think the receipt is gonna be an important clue in searchin' for Father's whereabouts.`
` We should tell the police about it when they come..."`
`"...Yes, you're right.`
` ...Yes.`
` I just felt a little triumphant when I figured out that part with the receipt.`
` ......Of course it isn't fair to only doubt Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` We're just as suspicious."`
`"......But still, Battler‐kun?`
` At least the part about the receipt is real, alright?`
` ...Don't forget this.`
` And try thinking deeply about what this means, okay...?"`
`"....................."`
`"...................................."`
`Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi stood up.`
`{n}It looked like they planned on leaving the parlor.`
`"In the end, it's pointless for us to continue playing detectives.`
` After all, the police will reveal everything in the end anyway."`
`.........That's right.`
`Even if we don't play this detective game, when the typhoon passes,`
` ...and those lively seagulls return to the harbor, everything will settle itself.`
`Yes.`
` If you think about it, this kind of crime is completely trivial.`
`......It will definitely be resolved—`
`even if we do nothing—`
`{i:when the seagulls cry}.`
`"...Natsuhi nee‐san, I'll take it that you don't want to see my face anymore?`
` I feel the same.`
` ...If I remember correctly, yesterday, you had some rooms prepared for us in the mansion so that we wouldn't need to go back to the guesthouse, right?"`
`"There should be a bath and a toilet there, as well as a lock and a chain to secure the door.`
` There's even a bed to lie on, and my husband will be able to watch TV without having to fight with Maria‐chan over which channel to watch, okay?"`
`"....................................`
` ......You may do as you please.`
` ...But...make sure to be cautious."`
`"Thank you, Nee‐san.`
` ...And mind your own business.`
` I'll be counting on you to keep an eye on everyone, alright?`
` Because the killer is definitely among us.`
` ...And Nee‐san, make sure you don't forget that you're being watched, too."`
`".........Haven't you made enough parting remarks?"`
`"...Yes, that's enough.`
` .........See you, Natsuhi nee‐san.`
` ......Genji‐san, please call for us when it's dinnertime.`
` Until then, we'll keep ourselves locked in with the chain."`
`"..........................."`
`"......Genji, Kanon.`
` Escort them to the guest room."`
`"We'll be fine.`
` I don't want to end up being escorted by the killer.`
` In fact, I would be more comfortable if nobody left this room until we reach ours.`
` .........Let's go, George."`
`"...............I'll stay here with everyone else."`
`"George...!`
` The killer is in this room.`
` Do you plan on staying in a place like that...?!"`
`"......Leaving this room...would be the same as suspecting one of my relatives.`
` ...I......refuse to believe that anyone in our family is capable of something so horrifying."`
`"George...!`
` ......Honey, say something to him...!"`
`".........George is already an adult.`
` ...If his code tells him not to leave this room, then it's up to him.`
` Let him do what he wants..."`
`"...Father..."`
`Auntie Eva and Uncle Hideyoshi left.`
`{n}The only voice that called after them was the sound of the rain.`
`The parlor was being buried beneath the savage atmosphere...`
`{n}When I looked at the clock, I was surprised to find that it was already evening.`
`.........Had we really spent that much time worrying, talking, fighting about such needless things...?`
`Feeling bored, I started clawing at my head, when...`
`...Maria and I made eye contact.`
`Since I had thought she was completely immersed in the TV, I was a little surprised.`
`"......I'll believe it now."`
`"Uu...?"`
`"The letter, the murders, everything—it was all {f:5:Beatrice}.`
` ...No, actually, I wish she would just come out and say that was true.`
` .........I want it to be the work of a 19th person.`
` Otherwise, the 18 of us will have to keep on doubting each other...`
` ...I think believing in a 19th person is better than that..."`
`".............................."`
`"...Bringing Grandfather outside without opening the doors or windows must be a piece of cake for {f:5:Beatrice}, right...?"`
`Maria, after taking a single, short breath, hung her head, ......and then raised her face again.`
`"............That's right.`
` Kihihihihihihihi, locking a door is useless against a witch.`
` ......{f:5:Beatrice} is familiar with all 72 demons.`
` The 33rd ranked, Gaap, gives the power to instantly carry the desired person to any location."`
`"...To her, taking a person out of any locked room isn't hard at all, you see?`
` Kihihi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hi{0}hihi..."`
`"Witches sure are incredible.`
` ......Tell her, if she still plans on committing another crime, to do it in a way that no human could,`
` ......to make me believe that a 19th person,`
` ......no, a witch, exists."`
`".................................Kihihi.`
` ......Alright.`
` If I meet her, I'll tell her."`
`Dammit...`
` I don't even understand my own thoughts anymore...`
`When I'm led to believe in a 19th person, I deny it, and when I'm led to believe that there are only 18 people, I deny that too.`
`Even though I wish that there were more than just the 18 people here, I can't accept the existence of that 19th person.`
`......In short, even though there are more than 18 people, there are less than 19.`
`{n}......The number of people in this mansion is 19>X>18.`
`{n}So the number of people can't be represented by an integer.`
`......However, it's impossible for there to be anything after the decimal point.`
`{n}You shouldn't be able to represent the number of people with anything but an integer.`
`...And yet, 19>X>18.`
`{n}Why does a fraction less than 1 play into this...!`
`It's no wonder.`
` ...That 19th person is an {i:invisible being, that can't be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}}.`
`{n}That's why, in the integer representation that must be used to describe numbers of people, she {i:can't be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}}.`
`That witch cannot be {y:1:‘seen’}{n:1:seen}.`
`{n}Because {f:5:Beatrice} has no body.`
`{n}Therefore, she is invisible.`
`Is there a 19th person, or not?`
`{n}Does the witch exist, or not?`
`19>X>18.`
`{n}...The witch exists somewhere in that X...!`
